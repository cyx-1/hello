**[08:09]** had a negative consequence and only

**[08:09]** had a negative consequence and only moving to LA now 2 years ago did the

**[08:12]** moving to LA now 2 years ago did the

**[08:12]** moving to LA now 2 years ago did the shift. And this is because I got pulled

**[08:14]** shift. And this is because I got pulled

### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** companies that were growing very

**[11:00]** companies that were growing very rapidly. And I compare that, people talk

**[11:02]** rapidly. And I compare that, people talk

**[11:02]** rapidly. And I compare that, people talk about a career ladder. Well, my ladder

**[11:04]** about a career ladder. Well, my ladder

**[11:04]** about a career ladder. Well, my ladder was always an escalator. I could climb,

**[11:07]** was always an escalator. I could climb,

**[11:07]** was always an escalator. I could climb, but it was also moving up for me. And

**[11:09]** but it was also moving up for me. And

**[11:09]** but it was also moving up for me. And so, the reason I got where I went is

**[11:11]** so, the reason I got where I went is

**[11:11]** so, the reason I got where I went is because Amazon grew 100fold while I was

**[11:15]** because Amazon grew 100fold while I was
