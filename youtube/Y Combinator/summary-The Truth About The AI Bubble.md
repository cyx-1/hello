- **Telecom bubble comparison:** Overinvestment in infrastructure (fiber optics) enabled future innovation (YouTube)
- AI "glut" is actually good for startups: cheap compute and inference
- Nvidia stock concerns don't affect startup viability
- Big companies bear the capex risk; if demand falls, it's their problem, not startups'
- College students increasingly asking about bubble concerns

- Currently in transition from installation to deployment
- ChatGPT moment (2023) kicked off the installation phase
- The future Facebook/Google equivalents of the AI era haven't been started yet
- GPUs and foundation models are infrastructure, not end products

**Key Points:**
- **Power generation** becoming major bottleneck for AI infrastructure
- Boom Supersonic pivoting to power generation for AI data centers
- Jet engine supply chain backed up 2-3 years
- Land and regulatory constraints (CEQA in California) limiting expansion
- Space as escape valve for infrastructure needs
- **YC "trifecta":** StarCloud (space data centers), Boom (energy), Helion (fusion)
- Zephyr Fusion: Space fusion company combining both solutions

---

### 8. [Model Company Trends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqrJzG03ENE&t=1050s)

**Timestamp:** 17:30 - 21:00

**Key Points:**
- Interest in starting model companies at both ends of the spectrum
- Few can raise capital for head-on OpenAI competitors (exception: SSI with Ilya Sutskever)
- More YC companies building smaller, specialized models (edge devices, language-specific)
- **Democratization of AI research knowledge** (similar to startup knowledge explosion)
- RL and fine-tuning enabling domain-specific models
- **Healthcare startup example:** 8B parameter model outperforming OpenAI on healthcare benchmarks
- Need for continuous post-training infrastructure to keep up with foundation model improvements

### 12. [Team Size & Hiring Trends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqrJzG03ENE&t=1550s)

**Timestamp:** 25:50 - 29:00

**Key Points:**
- **Last year (2024):** Companies hitting $1M ARR with minimal/no hiring
- **This year (2025):** Post-Series A companies started hiring actual teams
- Two competing hypotheses:
  1. AI makes everything more efficient (smaller teams)
  2. AI raises expectations, requiring more people (larger teams)
- 2025 trending toward second hypothesis - companies still hiring at pre-AI rates
- Bottleneck on execution, not ideas
- Competitive pressure driving hiring (Harvey vs Lora, Giga vs Sierra)
- **Gamma example:** $100M ARR with only 50 employees (new efficiency benchmark)
- "One person trillion-dollar company" not yet arrived (but trending that way)

**Timestamp:** 27:00 - 28:30

**Key Points:**
- **First wave (2023):** Early AI-native companies like Harvey did "victory lap"
- Many wasted capital on fine-tuning that provided no lasting advantage
- **Second wave (2025):** Companies like Lora and Giga challenging incumbents
- "Capital as moat" strategy: "Block out Sand Hill Road" to prevent competition
- Investors as winners when companies waste capital on fine-tuning
- Competition still fierce despite first-mover advantage
