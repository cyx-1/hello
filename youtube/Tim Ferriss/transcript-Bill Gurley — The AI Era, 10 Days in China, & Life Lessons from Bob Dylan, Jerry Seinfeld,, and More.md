subject matter.

subject matter. AI bubble or not? [clears throat]

AI bubble or not? [clears throat]

AI bubble or not? [clears throat] [laughter]

[laughter]

[laughter] And if so, what does that mean?

And if so, what does that mean?

And if so, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think this is super

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think this is super

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think this is super interesting. My my partner Peter

interesting. My my partner Peter

interesting. My my partner Peter reminded me of a book that we had seen a

reminded me of a book that we had seen a

reminded me of a book that we had seen a a while ago by Carlaua Perez. It has

a while ago by Carlaua Perez. It has

a while ago by Carlaua Perez. It has this very benign title, Technological

this very benign title, Technological

this very benign title, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. It

Revolutions and Financial Capital. It

Revolutions and Financial Capital. It was written in like 2002.

was written in like 2002.

was written in like 2002. And what Perez

And what Perez

And what Perez kind of simplifies and notices, which I

kind of simplifies and notices, which I

kind of simplifies and notices, which I just find perfect for trying to

just find perfect for trying to

just find perfect for trying to understand whether there's a bubble or

understand whether there's a bubble or

understand whether there's a bubble or not, is that every time there's been a

not, is that every time there's been a

not, is that every time there's been a technology wave that leads to wealth

technology wave that leads to wealth

technology wave that leads to wealth creation, especially fast wealth

creation, especially fast wealth

creation, especially fast wealth creation, that will inherently invite

creation, that will inherently invite

creation, that will inherently invite speculators, carpet baggers, interlopers

speculators, carpet baggers, interlopers

speculators, carpet baggers, interlopers that want to come take advantage of it.

that want to come take advantage of it.

that want to come take advantage of it. think of the gold rush, you know, and so

think of the gold rush, you know, and so

think of the gold rush, you know, and so people want to make it a debate. Do you

people want to make it a debate. Do you

people want to make it a debate. Do you believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if

believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if

believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if you say you think it's a bubble, they

you say you think it's a bubble, they

you say you think it's a bubble, they say, "Oh, you don't believe in AI." Like

say, "Oh, you don't believe in AI." Like

say, "Oh, you don't believe in AI." Like this gotcha kind of thing. And if you

### [04:00 - 05:00]

this gotcha kind of thing. And if you

this gotcha kind of thing. And if you study Perez, and I I think this is

study Perez, and I I think this is

study Perez, and I I think this is absolutely correct. If the wave is real,

absolutely correct. If the wave is real,

absolutely correct. If the wave is real, then you're going to have bubble-like

then you're going to have bubble-like

then you're going to have bubble-like behavior. like they come together as a

behavior. like they come together as a

behavior. like they come together as a pair precisely because anytime there's

pair precisely because anytime there's

pair precisely because anytime there's very quick wealth creation, you're going

very quick wealth creation, you're going

very quick wealth creation, you're going to get a lot of people that want to come

to get a lot of people that want to come

to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or

try and take advantage of that or

try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So, you get a flood

participate in it. So, you get a flood

participate in it. So, you get a flood of those types of people coming at it.

of those types of people coming at it.

of those types of people coming at it. [clears throat] And so, it's odd.

[clears throat] And so, it's odd.

[clears throat] And so, it's odd. There's a real technology wave that's

There's a real technology wave that's

There's a real technology wave that's that's fundamentally changing the world

that's fundamentally changing the world

that's fundamentally changing the world and there's also massive speculation

and there's also massive speculation

and there's also massive speculation simultaneous. Yeah, they come as a pair.

simultaneous. Yeah, they come as a pair.

simultaneous. Yeah, they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago, maybe two

I recall not too long ago, maybe two

I recall not too long ago, maybe two weeks ago, saw a short interview with

weeks ago, saw a short interview with

weeks ago, saw a short interview with your friend Jeff Bezos and he

your friend Jeff Bezos and he

your friend Jeff Bezos and he distinguished between financial bubbles

distinguished between financial bubbles

distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles and cited, and

and industrial bubbles and cited, and

and industrial bubbles and cited, and I'm paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an

I'm paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble, right?

### [05:00 - 06:00]

example of a bad bubble, right?

example of a bad bubble, right? financial bubble versus let's just say

financial bubble versus let's just say

financial bubble versus let's just say the early 2000s like 99 98 99 2000 where

the early 2000s like 99 98 99 2000 where

the early 2000s like 99 98 99 2000 where a lot of very important technology was

a lot of very important technology was

a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the

growth and he believes that AI would

growth and he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category

fall into the industrial bubble category

fall into the industrial bubble category of things but I suppose given that the

of things but I suppose given that the

of things but I suppose given that the dancing pair you described come

dancing pair you described come

dancing pair you described come together. How would you think about

together. How would you think about

together. How would you think about investing in private companies, modern

investing in private companies, modern

investing in private companies, modern venture capital at this point in time?

venture capital at this point in time?

is surprising to me is that even though

is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an

I fundamentally believe this is an

I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave, the big

important real technology wave, the big

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of talk out

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of talk out there, but it all started when Microsoft

there, but it all started when Microsoft

there, but it all started when Microsoft invested in OpenAI. Open AI agreed to

invested in OpenAI. Open AI agreed to

invested in OpenAI. Open AI agreed to buy services from Microsoft. Yeah,

buy services from Microsoft. Yeah,

buy services from Microsoft. Yeah, &gt;&gt; which is called a circular deal because
