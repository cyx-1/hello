**[00:58]** friends, here's Irving Thinkle. Where and when did writing originate in



### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** Where and when did writing originate in

**[01:01]** Where and when did writing originate in human civilization? Let's go back a few

**[01:03]** human civilization? Let's go back a few

**[01:03]** human civilization? Let's go back a few thousand years.

**[01:05]** thousand years.

**[01:05]** thousand years. &gt;&gt; The first attempts at writing that we

**[01:08]** &gt;&gt; The first attempts at writing that we

**[01:08]** &gt;&gt; The first attempts at writing that we could call writing go back to the middle

**[01:10]** could call writing go back to the middle

**[01:10]** could call writing go back to the middle of the fourth millennium say around 3500

**[01:13]** of the fourth millennium say around 3500

**[01:13]** of the fourth millennium say around 3500 BC something like that. There were

**[01:16]** BC something like that. There were

**[01:16]** BC something like that. There were people in the Middle East, individuals

**[01:17]** people in the Middle East, individuals

**[01:18]** people in the Middle East, individuals who lived between the Euphrates and

**[01:20]** who lived between the Euphrates and

**[01:20]** who lived between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers who had clay as their

**[01:22]** Tigris rivers who had clay as their

**[01:22]** Tigris rivers who had clay as their operating material for building and all

**[01:24]** operating material for building and all

**[01:24]** operating material for building and all sorts of other purposes. And eventually

**[01:26]** sorts of other purposes. And eventually

**[01:26]** sorts of other purposes. And eventually as a writing support, they somehow

**[01:29]** as a writing support, they somehow

**[01:29]** as a writing support, they somehow developed the idea of the basis of

**[01:31]** developed the idea of the basis of

**[01:31]** developed the idea of the basis of writing which means that you can make a

**[01:33]** writing which means that you can make a

**[01:33]** writing which means that you can make a sign which people agree on on a surface

**[01:36]** sign which people agree on on a surface

**[01:36]** sign which people agree on on a surface that another person when they see it,

**[01:38]** that another person when they see it,

**[01:38]** that another person when they see it, they know what sound it engenders. That

**[01:41]** they know what sound it engenders. That

**[01:41]** they know what sound it engenders. That is the essence of writing that there's

**[01:43]** is the essence of writing that there's

**[01:43]** is the essence of writing that there's an agreed system of symbols that A can

**[01:46]** an agreed system of symbols that A can

**[01:46]** an agreed system of symbols that A can use and B can then play back either in

**[01:49]** use and B can then play back either in

**[01:49]** use and B can then play back either in their heads or literally with their

**[01:50]** their heads or literally with their

**[01:50]** their heads or literally with their voice is a bit like a gramophone record.

**[01:54]** voice is a bit like a gramophone record.

**[01:54]** voice is a bit like a gramophone record. So when it really began is a terribly

**[01:57]** So when it really began is a terribly

**[01:57]** So when it really began is a terribly terribly awkward question for us because

**[01:59]** terribly awkward question for us because

**[01:59]** terribly awkward question for us because the truth of the matter is we have no



### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:01]** the truth of the matter is we have no

**[02:01]** the truth of the matter is we have no idea when anything began and all we can

**[02:04]** idea when anything began and all we can

**[02:04]** idea when anything began and all we can say is that the oldest evidence we have

**[02:06]** say is that the oldest evidence we have

**[02:06]** say is that the oldest evidence we have is around 3,500 BC. But whether that was

**[02:11]** is around 3,500 BC. But whether that was

**[02:11]** is around 3,500 BC. But whether that was anywhere near the time or the stage when

**[02:14]** anywhere near the time or the stage when

**[02:14]** anywhere near the time or the stage when this started off for for the first time

**[02:17]** this started off for for the first time

**[02:17]** this started off for for the first time seems to me very very unlikely.

**[02:20]** seems to me very very unlikely.

**[02:20]** seems to me very very unlikely. So in among these the Mesopotamians

**[02:23]** So in among these the Mesopotamians

**[02:23]** So in among these the Mesopotamians around 3,500 they started to do this.

**[02:26]** around 3,500 they started to do this.

**[02:26]** around 3,500 they started to do this. They made up signs which everybody

**[02:28]** They made up signs which everybody

**[02:28]** They made up signs which everybody understood and they could write simple

**[02:30]** understood and they could write simple

**[02:30]** understood and they could write simple pictographic messages. Foot is a foot, a

**[02:33]** pictographic messages. Foot is a foot, a

**[02:33]** pictographic messages. Foot is a foot, a leg is a leg and barley is barley. And

**[02:36]** leg is a leg and barley is barley. And

**[02:36]** leg is a leg and barley is barley. And then very very gradually they had the

**[02:39]** then very very gradually they had the

**[02:39]** then very very gradually they had the idea of how you could represent

**[02:41]** idea of how you could represent

**[02:41]** idea of how you could represent numerals. And then they had the idea

**[02:42]** numerals. And then they had the idea

**[02:42]** numerals. And then they had the idea that the pictures could also represent

**[02:44]** that the pictures could also represent

**[02:44]** that the pictures could also represent signs. And once they had the idea that

**[02:46]** signs. And once they had the idea that

**[02:46]** signs. And once they had the idea that you could write sounds with pictures,

**[02:49]** you could write sounds with pictures,

**[02:49]** you could write sounds with pictures, that's the crucial thing that a picture

**[02:51]** that's the crucial thing that a picture

**[02:51]** that's the crucial thing that a picture of a foot not only meant foot, but it

**[02:54]** of a foot not only meant foot, but it

**[02:54]** of a foot not only meant foot, but it meant the sound of the word for foot.

**[02:56]** meant the sound of the word for foot.

**[02:56]** meant the sound of the word for foot. Once this happened,

**[02:58]** Once this happened,

**[02:58]** Once this happened, some probably very very imaginative and



### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** some probably very very imaginative and

**[03:00]** some probably very very imaginative and clever persons had a kind of light bulb

**[03:03]** clever persons had a kind of light bulb

**[03:03]** clever persons had a kind of light bulb moment when they realized that they

**[03:06]** moment when they realized that they

**[03:06]** moment when they realized that they could develop a whole paniply of signs

**[03:10]** could develop a whole paniply of signs

**[03:10]** could develop a whole paniply of signs which could convey sound. And once you

**[03:13]** which could convey sound. And once you

**[03:13]** which could convey sound. And once you had that, you're liberated from

**[03:16]** had that, you're liberated from

**[03:16]** had that, you're liberated from pictographic writing into a position

**[03:18]** pictographic writing into a position

**[03:18]** pictographic writing into a position where you can record language. So

**[03:21]** where you can record language. So

**[03:21]** where you can record language. So language, grammar, and all the rest of

**[03:24]** language, grammar, and all the rest of

**[03:24]** language, grammar, and all the rest of it. before long proverbs and literature

**[03:27]** it. before long proverbs and literature

**[03:27]** it. before long proverbs and literature and all the other things that got

**[03:28]** and all the other things that got

**[03:28]** and all the other things that got written down. So it was a pretty

**[03:30]** written down. So it was a pretty

**[03:30]** written down. So it was a pretty gigantic step whenever it was taken but

**[03:33]** gigantic step whenever it was taken but

**[03:33]** gigantic step whenever it was taken but we really have no idea when it was first

**[03:34]** we really have no idea when it was first

**[03:34]** we really have no idea when it was first taken but the first evidence we have

**[03:37]** taken but the first evidence we have

**[03:37]** taken but the first evidence we have presents a sort of clearish sort of

**[03:39]** presents a sort of clearish sort of

**[03:39]** presents a sort of clearish sort of picture. It was simple and it got more

**[03:42]** picture. It was simple and it got more

**[03:42]** picture. It was simple and it got more complicated and then it became

**[03:43]** complicated and then it became

**[03:43]** complicated and then it became magnificent so that with all the signs a

**[03:47]** magnificent so that with all the signs a

**[03:47]** magnificent so that with all the signs a fluent and well-trained scribe could not

**[03:49]** fluent and well-trained scribe could not

**[03:49]** fluent and well-trained scribe could not only write down the Sumerian language

**[03:51]** only write down the Sumerian language

**[03:51]** only write down the Sumerian language which was one of the native tongues of

**[03:53]** which was one of the native tongues of

**[03:53]** which was one of the native tongues of Iraq and or the Babylonian language

**[03:56]** Iraq and or the Babylonian language

**[03:56]** Iraq and or the Babylonian language which was one the other main language of

**[03:58]** which was one the other main language of

**[03:58]** which was one the other main language of Iraq but also any other language he



### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** Iraq but also any other language he

**[04:00]** Iraq but also any other language he heard. So if somebody came speaking

**[04:03]** heard. So if somebody came speaking

**[04:03]** heard. So if somebody came speaking French ahead of their time and spoke out

**[04:06]** French ahead of their time and spoke out

**[04:06]** French ahead of their time and spoke out loud, he could record with these signs

**[04:09]** loud, he could record with these signs

**[04:09]** loud, he could record with these signs the sound of French. And we have

**[04:11]** the sound of French. And we have

**[04:11]** the sound of French. And we have examples of funny languages in the world

**[04:13]** examples of funny languages in the world

**[04:13]** examples of funny languages in the world around in the Bronze Age which were

**[04:15]** around in the Bronze Age which were

**[04:15]** around in the Bronze Age which were written in Q&amp;A form purely by ear. And

**[04:18]** written in Q&amp;A form purely by ear. And

**[04:18]** written in Q&amp;A form purely by ear. And often sometimes the scribes who recorded

**[04:20]** often sometimes the scribes who recorded

**[04:20]** often sometimes the scribes who recorded by dictation or by something wrote stuff

**[04:23]** by dictation or by something wrote stuff

**[04:23]** by dictation or by something wrote stuff they couldn't understand but somebody

**[04:24]** they couldn't understand but somebody

**[04:24]** they couldn't understand but somebody else could read and understand it. So

**[04:27]** else could read and understand it. So

**[04:27]** else could read and understand it. So what you have is long before the

**[04:29]** what you have is long before the

**[04:29]** what you have is long before the alphabet when the alphabet was not even

**[04:32]** alphabet when the alphabet was not even

**[04:32]** alphabet when the alphabet was not even a dream um complex bewildering looking

**[04:36]** a dream um complex bewildering looking

**[04:36]** a dream um complex bewildering looking off-putting writing system which was

**[04:38]** off-putting writing system which was

**[04:38]** off-putting writing system which was actually very beautiful flexible and

**[04:40]** actually very beautiful flexible and

**[04:40]** actually very beautiful flexible and lasted for well over 3 millennia

**[04:43]** lasted for well over 3 millennia

**[04:43]** lasted for well over 3 millennia probably closer to four millennia and it

**[04:45]** probably closer to four millennia and it

**[04:45]** probably closer to four millennia and it took a long time for the alphabet which

**[04:47]** took a long time for the alphabet which

**[04:47]** took a long time for the alphabet which anybody would say was much much more

**[04:48]** anybody would say was much much more

**[04:48]** anybody would say was much much more useful and much more sensible to

**[04:50]** useful and much more sensible to

**[04:50]** useful and much more sensible to displace it. So, it's one of the major

**[04:54]** displace it. So, it's one of the major

**[04:54]** displace it. So, it's one of the major stages of man's intellect because quite

**[04:57]** stages of man's intellect because quite

**[04:57]** stages of man's intellect because quite soon after the writing first took off,



### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** soon after the writing first took off,

**[05:02]** soon after the writing first took off, the signs began to proliferate and

**[05:05]** the signs began to proliferate and

**[05:05]** the signs began to proliferate and someone said, "Hey, we haven't got a

**[05:06]** someone said, "Hey, we haven't got a

**[05:06]** someone said, "Hey, we haven't got a sign for this sound or we haven't got a

**[05:08]** sign for this sound or we haven't got a

**[05:08]** sign for this sound or we haven't got a sign for this idea." And so it began to

**[05:13]** sign for this idea." And so it began to

**[05:13]** sign for this idea." And so it began to swell out and at some extremely

**[05:16]** swell out and at some extremely

**[05:16]** swell out and at some extremely remarkable stage, one probably only one

**[05:19]** remarkable stage, one probably only one

**[05:19]** remarkable stage, one probably only one person suddenly realized that if there

**[05:21]** person suddenly realized that if there

**[05:22]** person suddenly realized that if there was no control um they would grow

**[05:25]** was no control um they would grow

**[05:25]** was no control um they would grow exponentially and exponentially until it

**[05:27]** exponentially and exponentially until it

**[05:27]** exponentially and exponentially until it was all nonsense and everybody had their

**[05:28]** was all nonsense and everybody had their

**[05:28]** was all nonsense and everybody had their own writing. And the second thing is

**[05:30]** own writing. And the second thing is

**[05:30]** own writing. And the second thing is that no one could remember them unless

**[05:32]** that no one could remember them unless

**[05:32]** that no one could remember them unless they were written down in a retrievable

**[05:33]** they were written down in a retrievable

**[05:34]** they were written down in a retrievable way. So they invented not only writing

**[05:36]** way. So they invented not only writing

**[05:36]** way. So they invented not only writing they invented lexography

**[05:38]** they invented lexography

**[05:38]** they invented lexography which means that early in the third

**[05:40]** which means that early in the third

**[05:40]** which means that early in the third millennium they put down all the things

**[05:43]** millennium they put down all the things

**[05:43]** millennium they put down all the things that were made of wood and all the

**[05:45]** that were made of wood and all the

**[05:45]** that were made of wood and all the things that were made of reads and all

**[05:46]** things that were made of reads and all

**[05:46]** things that were made of reads and all the names of colors and of countries and

**[05:48]** the names of colors and of countries and

**[05:48]** the names of colors and of countries and all the gods and everything. They made a

**[05:50]** all the gods and everything. They made a

**[05:50]** all the gods and everything. They made a systematic attempt to make these signs

**[05:54]** systematic attempt to make these signs

**[05:54]** systematic attempt to make these signs um to standardize them and to make them

**[05:57]** um to standardize them and to make them

**[05:57]** um to standardize them and to make them retrievable and of course to teach them.

**[05:59]** retrievable and of course to teach them.

**[05:59]** retrievable and of course to teach them. And having exercised that rigor from the



### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:02]** And having exercised that rigor from the

**[06:02]** And having exercised that rigor from the outset, it meant that the thing became

**[06:05]** outset, it meant that the thing became

**[06:06]** outset, it meant that the thing became streamlined and stayed more or less as

**[06:09]** streamlined and stayed more or less as

**[06:09]** streamlined and stayed more or less as it was all the way through for three

**[06:11]** it was all the way through for three

**[06:11]** it was all the way through for three millennia or more because the stamp put

**[06:14]** millennia or more because the stamp put

**[06:14]** millennia or more because the stamp put on it by those early visionaries not

**[06:17]** on it by those early visionaries not

**[06:17]** on it by those early visionaries not only who um came up with the system and

**[06:20]** only who um came up with the system and

**[06:20]** only who um came up with the system and how it would work but to preserve it and

**[06:22]** how it would work but to preserve it and

**[06:22]** how it would work but to preserve it and to safeguard it was fantastically

**[06:25]** to safeguard it was fantastically

**[06:25]** to safeguard it was fantastically effective. So it means that there were

**[06:27]** effective. So it means that there were

**[06:27]** effective. So it means that there were scholars in Babylon in the 3rd century

**[06:30]** scholars in Babylon in the 3rd century

**[06:30]** scholars in Babylon in the 3rd century or the second century when Alexander was

**[06:31]** or the second century when Alexander was

**[06:32]** or the second century when Alexander was there for example. If somebody dug up a

**[06:34]** there for example. If somebody dug up a

**[06:34]** there for example. If somebody dug up a tablet in very early writing, they would

**[06:36]** tablet in very early writing, they would

**[06:36]** tablet in very early writing, they would have a pretty good idea what it meant.

**[06:37]** have a pretty good idea what it meant.

**[06:38]** have a pretty good idea what it meant. They would recognize the signs even

**[06:39]** They would recognize the signs even

**[06:39]** They would recognize the signs even though they were so ancient and they'd

**[06:41]** though they were so ancient and they'd

**[06:41]** though they were so ancient and they'd see the relationships between them. So

**[06:43]** see the relationships between them. So

**[06:43]** see the relationships between them. So you have a fantastically

**[06:45]** you have a fantastically

**[06:45]** you have a fantastically strong

**[06:47]** strong

**[06:47]** strong system where the spinal cord was

**[06:51]** system where the spinal cord was

**[06:51]** system where the spinal cord was structured in a lexographic regular

**[06:54]** structured in a lexographic regular

**[06:54]** structured in a lexographic regular system. So lexography and what the signs

**[06:57]** system. So lexography and what the signs

**[06:57]** system. So lexography and what the signs were was jealously safeguarded and



### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** were was jealously safeguarded and

**[07:01]** were was jealously safeguarded and protected and it lasted fantastically.

**[07:04]** protected and it lasted fantastically.

**[07:04]** protected and it lasted fantastically. &gt;&gt; We should say that the name of that

**[07:06]** &gt;&gt; We should say that the name of that

**[07:06]** &gt;&gt; We should say that the name of that system that lasted for 3,000 years is

**[07:09]** system that lasted for 3,000 years is

**[07:09]** system that lasted for 3,000 years is Kunea form.

**[07:10]** Kunea form.

**[07:10]** Kunea form. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So in the 19th century about 1840

**[07:13]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. So in the 19th century about 1840

**[07:14]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. So in the 19th century about 1840 1850 they started to find these things

**[07:16]** 1850 they started to find these things

**[07:16]** 1850 they started to find these things on excavations in Iraq the big Assyrian

**[07:19]** on excavations in Iraq the big Assyrian

**[07:19]** on excavations in Iraq the big Assyrian cities and sometimes further south the

**[07:21]** cities and sometimes further south the

**[07:21]** cities and sometimes further south the Babylonian cities. They found these clay

**[07:24]** Babylonian cities. They found these clay

**[07:24]** Babylonian cities. They found these clay tablets which in the ground lasted

**[07:27]** tablets which in the ground lasted

**[07:27]** tablets which in the ground lasted unimaginable lengths of time and they

**[07:30]** unimaginable lengths of time and they

**[07:30]** unimaginable lengths of time and they were all written in what we call

**[07:31]** were all written in what we call

**[07:31]** were all written in what we call kuneaoiform script. And the kuneaoiform

**[07:34]** kuneaoiform script. And the kuneaoiform

**[07:34]** kuneaoiform script. And the kuneaoiform part of it means wedge shaped because

**[07:37]** part of it means wedge shaped because

**[07:37]** part of it means wedge shaped because kunea in Latin means wedge. And when

**[07:40]** kunea in Latin means wedge. And when

**[07:40]** kunea in Latin means wedge. And when they first saw these signs they realized

**[07:43]** they first saw these signs they realized

**[07:43]** they first saw these signs they realized that a cluster of marks broke down into

**[07:47]** that a cluster of marks broke down into

**[10:08]** it's rather paradoxical

**[10:08]** it's rather paradoxical because the first generation or so of

**[10:26]** secondary phase as we understand it from archaeology is the perception that you

**[10:31]** could take these signs still meaning what they look like but also what the

**[10:33]** what they look like but also what the

**[10:33]** what they look like but also what the word sounded like. So then you have all

**[10:35]** word sounded like. So then you have all

**[10:58]** had sound. Well, I have to say I find

**[10:58]** had sound. Well, I have to say I find this very hard to believe because if you



### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:01]** this very hard to believe because if you

**[11:01]** this very hard to believe because if you had a group of people in an environment

**[11:04]** had a group of people in an environment

**[11:04]** had a group of people in an environment where it was compellingly necessary to

**[11:10]** make a system that you made marks on a surface which everybody could understand

**[11:12]** surface which everybody could understand

**[11:12]** surface which everybody could understand and use. Why wouldn't you start out with

**[11:15]** and use. Why wouldn't you start out with

**[11:15]** and use. Why wouldn't you start out with signs that made sounds? Because

**[11:18]** signs that made sounds? Because

**[11:18]** signs that made sounds? Because everybody speaks the same language,

**[11:21]** everybody speaks the same language,

**[11:21]** everybody speaks the same language, right? So you we they didn't have a b

**[11:23]** right? So you we they didn't have a b

**[11:23]** right? So you we they didn't have a b cde e fg but they could easily work out

**[11:26]** cde e fg but they could easily work out

**[11:26]** cde e fg but they could easily work out all the vowels and consonants without

**[11:28]** all the vowels and consonants without naming them as vowels and consonants but

**[11:30]** naming them as vowels and consonants but

**[11:30]** naming them as vowels and consonants but the component parts. So they could have

**[11:32]** the component parts. So they could have

**[11:32]** the component parts. So they could have had signs that started out because if

**[11:35]** had signs that started out because if

**[11:35]** had signs that started out because if you decided you had we have 26 let's say

**[11:37]** you decided you had we have 26 let's say

**[11:38]** you decided you had we have 26 let's say they had 50 signs that would create the

**[11:40]** they had 50 signs that would create the sound they could write anything without

**[11:42]** sound they could write anything without

**[11:42]** sound they could write anything without any further trouble. So I find it very

**[11:45]** any further trouble. So I find it very

**[11:45]** any further trouble. So I find it very bewildering that they started off with

**[11:47]** bewildering that they started off with

**[11:47]** bewildering that they started off with the least flexible and the least

**[11:55]** they moved on to the sound. I don't know

**[11:55]** they moved on to the sound. I don't know why they bothered with it. And my hunch

**[11:57]** why they bothered with it. And my hunch

**[12:00]** is that the archeological evidence that we have on this score is ultimately

**[12:32]** merchants come and they have three sheep

**[12:32]** merchants come and they have three sheep to sell, so they draw three little

**[25:40]** process? How hard is it? Maybe take us to this place of uh for you yourself

**[25:43]** to this place of uh for you yourself

**[25:43]** to this place of uh for you yourself first learning the language, figuring

**[25:55]** how do you then piece stuff together?

**[25:55]** how do you then piece stuff together? Maybe you can go to the the early days

**[25:58]** Maybe you can go to the the early days

**[25:58]** Maybe you can go to the the early days sort of the the Rosetta Stone of Kao



### [26:00 - 27:00]

**[26:00]** sort of the the Rosetta Stone of Kao

**[26:00]** sort of the the Rosetta Stone of Kao form also.

**[26:01]** form also.

**[26:01]** form also. &gt;&gt; That's important. Well, the first thing

**[26:02]** &gt;&gt; That's important. Well, the first thing

**[26:02]** &gt;&gt; That's important. Well, the first thing is is that how the Kunoifor writing

**[26:04]** is is that how the Kunoifor writing

**[26:04]** is is that how the Kunoifor writing system works because the crucial point

**[26:08]** system works because the crucial point

**[26:08]** system works because the crucial point and once you see it is makes a lot of

**[26:10]** and once you see it is makes a lot of

**[26:10]** and once you see it is makes a lot of things clear is that they wrote in

**[26:12]** things clear is that they wrote in

**[26:12]** things clear is that they wrote in syllables.

**[26:14]** syllables.

**[26:14]** syllables. So if you take the English alphabet,

**[26:16]** So if you take the English alphabet,

**[26:16]** So if you take the English alphabet, which of course they didn't, you had the

**[26:18]** which of course they didn't, you had the

**[26:18]** which of course they didn't, you had the letter B, G, D, P, H, and so forth. They

**[26:22]** letter B, G, D, P, H, and so forth. They

**[26:22]** letter B, G, D, P, H, and so forth. They couldn't write a consonant. They

**[26:25]** couldn't write a consonant. They

**[26:25]** couldn't write a consonant. They couldn't do that. So what they did is

**[26:27]** couldn't do that. So what they did is

**[26:27]** couldn't do that. So what they did is they had a vowel before a consonant or

**[26:30]** they had a vowel before a consonant or

**[26:30]** they had a vowel before a consonant or one after. So you have ab and ba. But as

**[26:35]** one after. So you have ab and ba. But as

**[26:35]** one after. So you have ab and ba. But as they had four vowels, you had to have ab

**[26:37]** they had four vowels, you had to have ab

**[26:38]** they had four vowels, you had to have ab and ba, ib and b, and b, e and be.

**[26:42]** and ba, ib and b, and b, e and be.

**[26:42]** and ba, ib and b, and b, e and be. &gt;&gt; Mhm. So you had the the range of things

**[26:45]** &gt;&gt; Mhm. So you had the the range of things

**[26:45]** &gt;&gt; Mhm. So you had the the range of things clustered around what we call a

**[26:46]** clustered around what we call a

**[26:46]** clustered around what we call a consonant. So they had all those for all

**[26:49]** consonant. So they had all those for all

**[26:49]** consonant. So they had all those for all the letters which gave them a basic

**[26:51]** the letters which gave them a basic

**[26:51]** the letters which gave them a basic system. There was much more to it than

**[26:53]** system. There was much more to it than

**[26:53]** system. There was much more to it than that and it was more complicated than

**[26:54]** that and it was more complicated than

**[26:54]** that and it was more complicated than that but we don't have to really go into

**[26:55]** that but we don't have to really go into

**[26:56]** that but we don't have to really go into it but basically if you are a Babylonian

**[26:59]** it but basically if you are a Babylonian

**[26:59]** it but basically if you are a Babylonian and um you want to write the word museum



### [27:00 - 28:00]

**[27:01]** and um you want to write the word museum

**[27:01]** and um you want to write the word museum which of course is one of the most

**[27:03]** which of course is one of the most

**[27:03]** which of course is one of the most important words in the English language

**[27:05]** important words in the English language

**[27:05]** important words in the English language and other languages too. So what you

**[27:07]** and other languages too. So what you

**[27:07]** and other languages too. So what you would do is you would write the syllable

**[27:08]** would do is you would write the syllable

**[27:08]** would do is you would write the syllable moo.

**[27:09]** moo.

**[27:09]** moo. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

**[27:09]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then the sign z and then the sign.

**[27:13]** &gt;&gt; And then the sign z and then the sign.

**[27:13]** &gt;&gt; And then the sign z and then the sign. So you split the word up into its

**[27:15]** So you split the word up into its

**[27:15]** So you split the word up into its component syllables. When you read it in

**[27:17]** component syllables. When you read it in

**[27:17]** component syllables. When you read it in your mind, you squash them together into

**[27:19]** your mind, you squash them together into

**[27:19]** your mind, you squash them together into museum. That's the basic system. They

**[27:22]** museum. That's the basic system. They

**[27:22]** museum. That's the basic system. They had other signs which gave you a clue as

**[27:25]** had other signs which gave you a clue as

**[27:25]** had other signs which gave you a clue as to the meaning and bits around the edge.

**[27:28]** to the meaning and bits around the edge.

**[27:28]** to the meaning and bits around the edge. But it's basically salabic writing.

**[27:30]** But it's basically salabic writing.

**[27:30]** But it's basically salabic writing. &gt;&gt; Mhm. So when you go to university to

**[27:33]** &gt;&gt; Mhm. So when you go to university to

**[27:33]** &gt;&gt; Mhm. So when you go to university to study kuneaoiform

**[27:36]** study kuneaoiform

**[27:36]** study kuneaoiform what you have to learn is all the signs

**[27:39]** what you have to learn is all the signs

**[27:40]** what you have to learn is all the signs and all their values because

**[27:42]** and all their values because

**[27:42]** and all their values because unfortunately they didn't just have one

**[27:45]** unfortunately they didn't just have one

**[27:45]** unfortunately they didn't just have one for each they had multiple ones and the

**[27:47]** for each they had multiple ones and the

**[27:48]** for each they had multiple ones and the reason is not that they were mad or they

**[27:50]** reason is not that they were mad or they

**[27:50]** reason is not that they were mad or they wanted to make life hell but because the

**[27:53]** wanted to make life hell but because the

**[27:53]** wanted to make life hell but because the syllables derived from the writing of

**[27:56]** syllables derived from the writing of

**[27:56]** syllables derived from the writing of Sumerian words. So the Sumerian



### [28:00 - 29:00]

**[28:00]** Sumerian words. So the Sumerian

**[28:00]** Sumerian words. So the Sumerian vocabulary had a lot of words that were

**[28:03]** vocabulary had a lot of words that were

**[28:03]** vocabulary had a lot of words that were probably differentiated by tone.

**[28:07]** probably differentiated by tone.

**[28:07]** probably differentiated by tone. &gt;&gt; So you might have bar and then a rising

**[28:09]** &gt;&gt; So you might have bar and then a rising

**[28:09]** &gt;&gt; So you might have bar and then a rising a and then a lowering. And these signs

**[28:12]** a and then a lowering. And these signs

**[28:12]** a and then a lowering. And these signs all retain the bar value even though

**[28:14]** all retain the bar value even though

**[28:14]** all retain the bar value even though there were no tones. So it means if you

**[28:17]** there were no tones. So it means if you

**[28:17]** there were no tones. So it means if you look at a sign list, there's a lot of

**[28:19]** look at a sign list, there's a lot of

**[28:19]** look at a sign list, there's a lot of signs. You have bar number one, which is

**[28:21]** signs. You have bar number one, which is

**[28:21]** signs. You have bar number one, which is the common, then there's bar number two,

**[28:22]** the common, then there's bar number two,

**[28:22]** the common, then there's bar number two, bar number three, and you have to learn

**[28:24]** bar number three, and you have to learn

**[28:24]** bar number three, and you have to learn them all. And when you read, you have to

**[28:26]** them all. And when you read, you have to

**[28:26]** them all. And when you read, you have to learn how to do it. So when in the

**[28:29]** learn how to do it. So when in the

**[28:29]** learn how to do it. So when in the modern world if you go to university to

**[28:31]** modern world if you go to university to

**[28:31]** modern world if you go to university to to do a seriology which I hope you and

**[28:33]** to do a seriology which I hope you and

**[28:33]** to do a seriology which I hope you and all of your disciples will do as soon as

**[28:35]** all of your disciples will do as soon as

**[28:35]** all of your disciples will do as soon as possible you actually have to cope with

**[28:38]** possible you actually have to cope with

**[28:38]** possible you actually have to cope with two languages the Sumerian and the

**[28:40]** two languages the Sumerian and the

**[28:40]** two languages the Sumerian and the Babylonian. Now the first thing is this

**[28:43]** Babylonian. Now the first thing is this

**[28:43]** Babylonian. Now the first thing is this that the Babylonian language is a smitic

**[28:46]** that the Babylonian language is a smitic

**[28:46]** that the Babylonian language is a smitic tongue which although it's extinct

**[28:50]** tongue which although it's extinct

### [29:00 - 30:00]

**[29:02]** are still alive. It's an early example

**[29:02]** are still alive. It's an early example of one of those. So that when the

**[29:04]** of one of those. So that when the

**[29:04]** of one of those. So that when the decipherment came along, it was the

**[29:06]** decipherment came along, it was the

**[29:06]** decipherment came along, it was the Semitic dictionary that they fell back

**[29:09]** Semitic dictionary that they fell back

**[29:09]** Semitic dictionary that they fell back on to identify words, nouns, and roots.

**[29:13]** on to identify words, nouns, and roots.

**[29:13]** on to identify words, nouns, and roots. The other language, which is Sumerian,

**[29:15]** The other language, which is Sumerian,

**[29:15]** The other language, which is Sumerian, the one when you stick bits in the

**[29:16]** the one when you stick bits in the

**[29:16]** the one when you stick bits in the beginning and stick bits at the end, is

**[29:19]** beginning and stick bits at the end, is

**[29:19]** beginning and stick bits at the end, is not only not Semitic. It's not related

**[29:22]** not only not Semitic. It's not related

**[29:22]** not only not Semitic. It's not related to any other known language.

**[29:25]** to any other known language.

**[29:28]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is a bewitching thing. It's a

**[29:28]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is a bewitching thing. It's a bewitching thing to me. And this is how

**[29:30]** bewitching thing to me. And this is how

**[29:30]** bewitching thing to me. And this is how to understand it because the languages

**[29:33]** to understand it because the languages

**[29:33]** to understand it because the languages that we study in the world today,

**[29:35]** that we study in the world today,

**[29:35]** that we study in the world today, linguists study, they more or less all

**[29:39]** linguists study, they more or less all

**[29:39]** linguists study, they more or less all fall into a language group. So you have

**[29:42]** fall into a language group. So you have

**[29:42]** fall into a language group. So you have Indo-Uropean with Spanish, Italian,

**[29:44]** Indo-Uropean with Spanish, Italian,

**[29:44]** Indo-Uropean with Spanish, Italian, Latin, Hittite,

**[29:47]** Latin, Hittite,

**[29:47]** Latin, Hittite, and so forth. And so that's why French,

**[29:48]** and so forth. And so that's why French,

**[29:48]** and so forth. And so that's why French, that's one group, and you have Germanic,

**[29:50]** that's one group, and you have Germanic,

**[29:50]** that's one group, and you have Germanic, and you have Savonic. And most

**[29:52]** and you have Savonic. And most

**[29:54]** languages, even the far-flung ones, fall

**[29:54]** languages, even the far-flung ones, fall into what can be seen to be maybe big

**[29:57]** into what can be seen to be maybe big

**[29:57]** into what can be seen to be maybe big and airy groups. Their family like that.



### [30:00 - 31:00]

**[30:00]** and airy groups. Their family like that.

**[30:00]** and airy groups. Their family like that. There's not one for Sumerian. So this

**[30:03]** There's not one for Sumerian. So this

**[30:03]** There's not one for Sumerian. So this means that the truth that languages do

**[30:06]** means that the truth that languages do

**[30:06]** means that the truth that languages do not exist in a vacuum, but they're part

**[30:08]** not exist in a vacuum, but they're part

**[30:08]** not exist in a vacuum, but they're part of a big family must always have been

**[30:11]** of a big family must always have been

**[30:11]** of a big family must always have been true. So that when writing arrives about

**[30:13]** true. So that when writing arrives about

**[30:13]** true. So that when writing arrives about 3,00 say 300 BC

**[30:17]** 3,00 say 300 BC

**[30:17]** 3,00 say 300 BC to write proper properly it means that

**[30:20]** to write proper properly it means that

**[38:19]** very much. So what So you're saying one one sign

**[38:21]** So what So you're saying one one sign

**[38:21]** So what So you're saying one one sign that looks exactly the same might have

**[38:22]** that looks exactly the same might have

**[38:22]** that looks exactly the same might have different sounds given the context.

**[38:24]** different sounds given the context.

**[38:24]** different sounds given the context. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you have to choose the right

**[38:26]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you have to choose the right

**[38:26]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you have to choose the right sound and and and also different meaning

**[38:30]** sound and and and also different meaning

**[38:30]** sound and and and also different meaning as well because for example if you if

**[38:32]** as well because for example if you if

**[38:32]** as well because for example if you if you have a sign for hot word hot right

**[38:35]** you have a sign for hot word hot right

**[38:35]** you have a sign for hot word hot right you you can't really have a picture sign

**[38:39]** for hot

**[38:39]** for hot doesn't make sense but what they did is

**[38:40]** doesn't make sense but what they did is

**[38:40]** doesn't make sense but what they did is they did a drawing of a kind of um

**[38:45]** they did a drawing of a kind of um

**[38:45]** they did a drawing of a kind of um complex thing with a brazer inside

**[38:46]** complex thing with a brazer inside

**[38:46]** complex thing with a brazer inside another sign which meant hot. So that

**[38:49]** another sign which meant hot. So that

**[38:49]** another sign which meant hot. So that sign existed but it also meant other

**[38:51]** sign existed but it also meant other

**[38:51]** sign existed but it also meant other things as well and you had to choose the

**[38:53]** things as well and you had to choose the

**[38:53]** things as well and you had to choose the right one for the contest. is all a

**[38:55]** right one for the contest. is all a

**[38:57]** context to matter. I mean, it really is

**[38:57]** context to matter. I mean, it really is quite a matter for despair when you

**[38:59]** quite a matter for despair when you

**[38:59]** quite a matter for despair when you start ka form because on top of



### [39:00 - 40:00]

**[39:01]** start ka form because on top of

**[39:01]** start ka form because on top of everything else, they didn't leave gaps

**[39:03]** everything else, they didn't leave gaps

**[39:03]** everything else, they didn't leave gaps between the words. They're all

**[39:05]** between the words. They're all

**[39:05]** between the words. They're all connected. That's really mean. Yeah. So

**[39:07]** connected. That's really mean. Yeah. So

**[39:07]** connected. That's really mean. Yeah. So when you read um what you have to do you

**[39:10]** when you read um what you have to do you

**[39:10]** when you read um what you have to do you start with the first sign and you think

**[39:12]** start with the first sign and you think

**[39:12]** start with the first sign and you think of the sign list and you go through the

**[39:15]** of the sign list and you go through the

**[39:15]** of the sign list and you go through the values in your mind and there's next

**[39:17]** values in your mind and there's next

**[39:17]** values in your mind and there's next sign and if one is bar and the next one

**[39:19]** sign and if one is bar and the next one

**[39:19]** sign and if one is bar and the next one is ab among other readings bar ab sounds

**[39:23]** is ab among other readings bar ab sounds

**[39:23]** is ab among other readings bar ab sounds like a syllable structure for a word and

**[39:25]** like a syllable structure for a word and

**[39:25]** like a syllable structure for a word and you go on like that.

**[39:26]** you go on like that.

**[39:26]** you go on like that. &gt;&gt; So there are two things about it. One is

**[39:28]** &gt;&gt; So there are two things about it. One is

**[39:28]** &gt;&gt; So there are two things about it. One is that if you want to you can master it.

**[39:31]** that if you want to you can master it.

**[39:31]** that if you want to you can master it. The other thing is that the number of

**[39:32]** The other thing is that the number of

**[39:32]** The other thing is that the number of variables was restricted. They

**[39:35]** variables was restricted. They

**[39:35]** variables was restricted. They controlled it. So it wasn't insane. So

**[39:37]** controlled it. So it wasn't insane. So

**[39:37]** controlled it. So it wasn't insane. So in other words, if you learn the corpus

**[39:39]** in other words, if you learn the corpus

**[39:39]** in other words, if you learn the corpus and you learn how the signs are composed

**[39:41]** and you learn how the signs are composed

**[39:41]** and you learn how the signs are composed and you learn their different values,

**[39:42]** and you learn their different values,

**[39:42]** and you learn their different values, then you've got it down

**[39:44]** then you've got it down

**[39:44]** then you've got it down &gt;&gt; and off you go. And and um it's it's

**[39:48]** &gt;&gt; and off you go. And and um it's it's

**[39:48]** &gt;&gt; and off you go. And and um it's it's very beautiful. I think it's it's

**[39:50]** very beautiful. I think it's it's

**[39:50]** very beautiful. I think it's it's marvelous.

**[39:51]** marvelous.

**[39:51]** marvelous. &gt;&gt; Can you in all seriousness take me back

**[39:53]** &gt;&gt; Can you in all seriousness take me back

**[39:54]** &gt;&gt; Can you in all seriousness take me back to the time when you were learning it?

**[39:55]** to the time when you were learning it?

**[39:55]** to the time when you were learning it? What's the process of learning it? Well,

**[39:57]** What's the process of learning it? Well,

**[39:57]** What's the process of learning it? Well, I had very abnormal upbringing because

**[39:59]** I had very abnormal upbringing because



### [40:00 - 41:00]

**[40:00]** I had very abnormal upbringing because when I went to university um for about

**[47:12]** thing that strikes me as relevant is

**[47:12]** thing that strikes me as relevant is that a very huge proportion of scholarly

**[47:16]** that a very huge proportion of scholarly

**[47:16]** that a very huge proportion of scholarly literature in Mesopotamia, it takes the

**[01:04:01]** makes moments really precious is that they're going to be gone. I think that's

**[01:04:03]** they're going to be gone. I think that's

**[01:04:04]** they're going to be gone. I think that's not a trivial thing for us humans to

**[01:04:06]** not a trivial thing for us humans to

**[01:04:06]** not a trivial thing for us humans to really contend with. I think religion,

**[01:04:09]** really contend with. I think religion,

**[01:04:09]** really contend with. I think religion, religious thought, the divine, I think,

**[01:04:11]** religious thought, the divine, I think,

**[01:04:11]** religious thought, the divine, I think, help with that.

**[01:04:12]** help with that.

**[01:04:12]** help with that. &gt;&gt; I I think the big mistake for mankind

**[01:04:15]** &gt;&gt; I I think the big mistake for mankind

**[01:04:15]** &gt;&gt; I I think the big mistake for mankind was the creation of monotheistic

**[01:04:17]** was the creation of monotheistic

**[01:04:17]** was the creation of monotheistic religions because they brought evil into

**[01:04:20]** religions because they brought evil into

**[01:04:20]** religions because they brought evil into the world because if you believe in a

**[01:04:23]** the world because if you believe in a

**[01:04:23]** the world because if you believe in a monotheistic religion, it means I'm

**[01:04:25]** monotheistic religion, it means I'm

**[01:04:25]** monotheistic religion, it means I'm right and you're wrong if you don't. So,

**[01:04:29]** right and you're wrong if you don't. So,

**[01:04:29]** right and you're wrong if you don't. So, it's already on that footing. That's

**[01:04:31]** it's already on that footing. That's

**[01:04:31]** it's already on that footing. That's &gt;&gt; very dogmatic. Yeah,

**[01:04:32]** &gt;&gt; very dogmatic. Yeah,

**[01:04:32]** &gt;&gt; very dogmatic. Yeah, &gt;&gt; dogmatic and it's led to everything.

**[01:04:35]** &gt;&gt; dogmatic and it's led to everything.

**[01:04:35]** &gt;&gt; dogmatic and it's led to everything. Inquisitions and this, you know, all

**[01:04:37]** Inquisitions and this, you know, all

**[01:04:38]** Inquisitions and this, you know, all this kind of stuff. It's all as a result

**[01:04:39]** this kind of stuff. It's all as a result

**[01:04:39]** this kind of stuff. It's all as a result of it that one religion is superior and

**[01:04:41]** of it that one religion is superior and

**[01:04:41]** of it that one religion is superior and the other should be stamped out and all

**[01:04:42]** the other should be stamped out and all

**[01:04:42]** the other should be stamped out and all that. And in my opinion, the

**[01:04:45]** that. And in my opinion, the

**[01:04:45]** that. And in my opinion, the monotheistic religion has generated the

**[01:04:47]** monotheistic religion has generated the

**[01:04:47]** monotheistic religion has generated the most fantastic amount of non-religious

**[01:04:50]** most fantastic amount of non-religious

**[01:04:50]** most fantastic amount of non-religious feeling. Whereas when you have all the

**[01:04:53]** feeling. Whereas when you have all the

**[01:04:53]** feeling. Whereas when you have all the different gods and have different

**[01:04:54]** different gods and have different

### [01:05:00 - 01:06:00]

**[01:05:00]** their temples and their offerings. It

**[01:05:00]** their temples and their offerings. It was very interesting to me to go um into

**[01:05:03]** was very interesting to me to go um into

**[01:05:03]** was very interesting to me to go um into a temple in Kolkata when I went to there

**[01:05:06]** a temple in Kolkata when I went to there

**[01:05:06]** a temple in Kolkata when I went to there with my wife Joanna. We went into the

**[01:05:09]** with my wife Joanna. We went into the

**[01:05:09]** with my wife Joanna. We went into the temples and saw how they were and I

**[01:05:10]** temples and saw how they were and I

**[01:05:10]** temples and saw how they were and I think they must be very much like the

**[01:05:12]** think they must be very much like the

**[01:05:12]** think they must be very much like the ones in Mesopotamia. So there was never

**[01:05:14]** ones in Mesopotamia. So there was never

**[01:05:14]** ones in Mesopotamia. So there was never anything about them which affronted

**[01:05:16]** anything about them which affronted

**[01:05:16]** anything about them which affronted people's individuality

**[01:05:18]** people's individuality

**[01:05:18]** people's individuality or or or I mean there's no religious

**[01:05:26]** antiquity. All these things are modern

**[01:05:26]** antiquity. All these things are modern disadvantageous matters. If you think

**[01:05:29]** disadvantageous matters. If you think

**[01:05:31]** what's done in the name of religion, it

**[01:05:31]** what's done in the name of religion, it is absolutely staggering.

**[01:05:33]** is absolutely staggering.

**[01:05:33]** is absolutely staggering. &gt;&gt; So let's talk go to literature because

**[01:05:36]** &gt;&gt; So let's talk go to literature because

**[01:05:36]** &gt;&gt; So let's talk go to literature because uh we didn't really mention literature

**[01:05:37]** uh we didn't really mention literature

**[01:05:38]** uh we didn't really mention literature much except you did briefly mention Epic

**[01:05:39]** much except you did briefly mention Epic

**[01:05:40]** much except you did briefly mention Epic of Gilgamesh. Yeah.

**[01:05:41]** of Gilgamesh. Yeah.

**[01:05:41]** of Gilgamesh. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that was written in Kunea form. It's

**[01:05:43]** &gt;&gt; So that was written in Kunea form. It's

**[01:05:43]** &gt;&gt; So that was written in Kunea form. It's one of the earliest works of literature.

**[01:05:45]** one of the earliest works of literature.

**[01:05:45]** one of the earliest works of literature. &gt;&gt; That's right.

**[01:05:45]** &gt;&gt; That's right.

**[01:05:45]** &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh can you tell me about this work?

**[01:05:47]** &gt;&gt; Uh can you tell me about this work?

**[01:05:47]** &gt;&gt; Uh can you tell me about this work? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we know it best from this

**[01:05:49]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we know it best from this

**[01:05:49]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we know it best from this Assyrian library set of tablets. There

**[01:05:51]** Assyrian library set of tablets. There

**[01:05:51]** Assyrian library set of tablets. There are 12 of them. It's a 12 tablet work.

**[01:05:54]** are 12 of them. It's a 12 tablet work.

**[01:05:54]** are 12 of them. It's a 12 tablet work. It's quite long. And Gilgamesh is the

**[01:05:56]** It's quite long. And Gilgamesh is the

**[01:05:56]** It's quite long. And Gilgamesh is the hero of it. But the literature, we know



### [01:06:00 - 01:07:00]

**[01:06:00]** hero of it. But the literature, we know

**[01:06:02]** it from earlier texts and we know that

**[01:06:02]** it from earlier texts and we know that Gilgamesh lived. He was a real person.

**[01:06:05]** Gilgamesh lived. He was a real person.

**[01:06:11]** those people who lived after their death

**[01:06:12]** those people who lived after their death in the world like Alexander for example.

**[01:06:15]** in the world like Alexander for example.

**[01:06:15]** in the world like Alexander for example. So there were stories about Gilgamesh

**[01:06:17]** So there were stories about Gilgamesh

**[01:06:17]** So there were stories about Gilgamesh when he was alive. There were stories

**[01:06:18]** when he was alive. There were stories

**[01:06:20]** about him afterwards and they firstly

**[01:06:20]** about him afterwards and they firstly they were oral literature

**[01:06:23]** they were oral literature

**[01:06:23]** they were oral literature not written down at all and then around

**[01:06:26]** not written down at all and then around

**[01:06:26]** not written down at all and then around the 1800s people started to write them

**[01:06:29]** the 1800s people started to write them

**[01:06:29]** the 1800s people started to write them down in Samrian or Babylonian. So there

**[01:06:31]** down in Samrian or Babylonian. So there

**[01:06:32]** down in Samrian or Babylonian. So there was a corpus and eventually they were

**[01:06:33]** was a corpus and eventually they were

**[01:06:33]** was a corpus and eventually they were woven into this long 12 homeriic type

**[01:06:36]** woven into this long 12 homeriic type

**[01:06:36]** woven into this long 12 homeriic type thing about the adventures of Gilgamesh.

**[01:06:38]** thing about the adventures of Gilgamesh.

**[01:06:38]** thing about the adventures of Gilgamesh. So it is certainly literature and um

**[01:06:42]** So it is certainly literature and um

**[01:06:42]** So it is certainly literature and um it's to do with humanity and immortality

**[01:06:44]** it's to do with humanity and immortality

**[01:06:58]** um even in the sophisticated nine

**[01:06:58]** um even in the sophisticated nine version its roots are in oral literature



### [01:07:00 - 01:08:00]

**[01:07:01]** version its roots are in oral literature

**[01:07:02]** version its roots are in oral literature because when somebody speaks it says

**[01:07:04]** because when somebody speaks it says

**[01:07:04]** because when somebody speaks it says Gilgamesh opened his mouth to speak and

**[01:07:06]** Gilgamesh opened his mouth to speak and

**[01:07:06]** Gilgamesh opened his mouth to speak and addressed his friend Enkidu and then

**[01:07:09]** addressed his friend Enkidu and then

**[01:07:14]** Gilgamesh. Well, when you're reading a

**[01:07:14]** Gilgamesh. Well, when you're reading a story, you don't need that.

**[01:07:17]** story, you don't need that.

**[01:07:17]** story, you don't need that. And that must be because of when there

**[01:07:19]** And that must be because of when there

**[01:07:19]** And that must be because of when there was when there was a enacting of an oral

**[01:07:22]** was when there was a enacting of an oral

**[01:07:22]** was when there was a enacting of an oral thing a narrator would say and it

**[01:07:25]** thing a narrator would say and it

**[01:07:28]** suddenly got frozen into the text. So

**[01:07:28]** suddenly got frozen into the text. So it's it's very strange thing because if

**[01:07:30]** it's it's very strange thing because if

**[01:07:30]** it's it's very strange thing because if you're reading it is obvious that one

**[01:07:31]** you're reading it is obvious that one

**[01:07:32]** you're reading it is obvious that one person speaks and the other person

**[01:07:33]** person speaks and the other person

**[01:07:35]** speaks and and they always have this

**[01:07:38]** complicated thing stuck in the text. So

**[01:07:38]** complicated thing stuck in the text. So it must be an echo of presumably you

**[01:07:41]** it must be an echo of presumably you

**[01:23:24]** connected but the the ark you discover

**[01:23:24]** connected but the the ark you discover a thousand years

**[01:23:27]** a thousand years

**[01:23:27]** a thousand years so that means that story of the flood

**[01:23:31]** so that means that story of the flood

**[01:23:31]** so that means that story of the flood has been told many many times across

**[01:23:34]** has been told many many times across

**[01:23:34]** has been told many many times across that span to you know

**[01:23:37]** that span to you know

**[01:23:37]** that span to you know &gt;&gt; yeah do your homework or the flood is

**[01:23:39]** &gt;&gt; yeah do your homework or the flood is

**[01:23:39]** &gt;&gt; yeah do your homework or the flood is going to That's right.

**[01:23:40]** going to That's right.

**[01:23:40]** going to That's right. &gt;&gt; To all the

**[01:23:47]** built a coracore and they didn't do the

**[01:23:47]** built a coracore and they didn't do the waterproofing, right?

**[01:23:49]** waterproofing, right?

**[01:23:49]** waterproofing, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

**[01:23:49]** &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what will happen? It'll be out

**[01:23:51]** &gt;&gt; You know what will happen? It'll be out

**[01:27:13]** we built it on a small lagoon in in

**[01:27:13]** we built it on a small lagoon in in Kerala. It was just the most

**[01:27:15]** Kerala. It was just the most

**[01:27:17]** unbelievably wonderful thing because

**[01:27:17]** unbelievably wonderful thing because they used the instructions as a

**[01:27:19]** they used the instructions as a

**[01:27:27]** had wooden ribs. You see?

**[01:27:27]** had wooden ribs. You see? &gt;&gt; Mhm.

**[01:27:28]** &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And they could get wood ribs. They

**[01:27:30]** &gt;&gt; And they could get wood ribs. They

**[01:27:32]** worked out by computer the maximum

**[01:27:32]** worked out by computer the maximum maximum size they could do it when it

**[01:27:34]** maximum size they could do it when it

**[01:27:34]** maximum size they could do it when it would work. Beyond it, it would be

**[01:27:36]** would work. Beyond it, it would be

**[01:27:36]** would work. Beyond it, it would be impossible because once they built the

**[01:27:38]** impossible because once they built the

**[01:27:38]** impossible because once they built the curved ribs and then the stuff woven all

**[01:27:42]** curved ribs and then the stuff woven all

**[01:27:46]** bitammen, which is also very heavy to

**[01:27:46]** bitammen, which is also very heavy to make it waterproof. So they calculated

**[01:27:49]** make it waterproof. So they calculated

**[01:27:49]** make it waterproof. So they calculated the size and it worked. So they built

**[01:27:51]** the size and it worked. So they built

**[01:35:48]** three boards for it with the pieces. So

**[01:35:48]** three boards for it with the pieces. So it arrived in the middle of the second

**[01:35:56]** played it. So you have a game which the

**[01:35:56]** played it. So you have a game which the interesting point about it is that it

**[01:35:58]** interesting point about it is that it

**[01:35:58]** interesting point about it is that it spread

**[01:35:59]** spread



### [01:36:00 - 01:37:00]

**[01:36:00]** spread um across the gnome world um without

**[01:36:04]** um across the gnome world um without

**[01:36:04]** um across the gnome world um without written rules and without people

**[01:36:07]** written rules and without people

**[01:36:07]** written rules and without people necessarily knowing the same language.

**[01:36:10]** necessarily knowing the same language.

**[01:36:10]** necessarily knowing the same language. Um, so a merchant would go

**[01:36:14]** Um, so a merchant would go

**[01:36:14]** Um, so a merchant would go end up in a bar, you know, come from

**[01:36:17]** end up in a bar, you know, come from

**[01:36:17]** end up in a bar, you know, come from India or I don't know where and start pl

**[01:36:20]** India or I don't know where and start pl

**[01:36:20]** India or I don't know where and start pl seeing these guys playing have a go

**[01:36:21]** seeing these guys playing have a go

**[01:36:21]** seeing these guys playing have a go himself and it looks rather interesting.

**[01:36:23]** himself and it looks rather interesting.

**[01:36:23]** himself and it looks rather interesting. You go home and try and remember what it

**[01:36:25]** You go home and try and remember what it

**[01:36:25]** You go home and try and remember what it looked like and try and work out how to,

**[01:36:27]** looked like and try and work out how to,

**[01:36:27]** looked like and try and work out how to, you know, be transported this way and

**[01:36:29]** you know, be transported this way and

**[01:36:29]** you know, be transported this way and the other. And so you can see that that

**[01:36:32]** the other. And so you can see that that

**[01:36:32]** the other. And so you can see that that the board has 20 squares. So you have a

**[01:36:34]** the board has 20 squares. So you have a

**[01:36:34]** the board has 20 squares. So you have a block of 4x3 and then a bridge of two

**[01:36:37]** block of 4x3 and then a bridge of two

**[01:36:37]** block of 4x3 and then a bridge of two and then a second 3x two thing at the

**[01:36:41]** and then a second 3x two thing at the

**[01:36:41]** and then a second 3x two thing at the end. So it it's difficult to describe

**[01:36:44]** end. So it it's difficult to describe

**[01:36:44]** end. So it it's difficult to describe the actual shape. But what happened was

**[01:36:46]** the actual shape. But what happened was

**[01:36:46]** the actual shape. But what happened was after about 2,000 BC the squares at the

**[01:36:51]** after about 2,000 BC the squares at the

**[01:36:51]** after about 2,000 BC the squares at the far end which there were two on one

**[01:36:54]** far end which there were two on one

**[01:36:54]** far end which there were two on one flank and two on the other were all put

**[01:36:57]** flank and two on the other were all put

**[01:36:57]** flank and two on the other were all put at the end of the central avenue.

**[01:36:59]** at the end of the central avenue.

**[01:36:59]** at the end of the central avenue. &gt;&gt; So you end up with 12 squares down the



### [01:37:00 - 01:38:00]

**[01:37:01]** &gt;&gt; So you end up with 12 squares down the

**[01:37:01]** &gt;&gt; So you end up with 12 squares down the middle. So all the boards after the

**[01:37:04]** middle. So all the boards after the

**[01:37:04]** middle. So all the boards after the period of ore have 12 squares down the

**[01:37:06]** period of ore have 12 squares down the

**[01:37:06]** period of ore have 12 squares down the middle and then four on each side at one

**[01:37:09]** middle and then four on each side at one

**[01:37:09]** middle and then four on each side at one end. So it meant then that when you play

**[01:37:11]** end. So it meant then that when you play

**[01:37:11]** end. So it meant then that when you play the game you have dice to move the

**[01:37:13]** the game you have dice to move the

**[01:37:13]** the game you have dice to move the pieces. You have pieces all the same and

**[01:37:17]** pieces. You have pieces all the same and

**[01:37:17]** pieces. You have pieces all the same and you obviously put them on your first

**[01:37:19]** you obviously put them on your first

**[01:37:19]** you obviously put them on your first corner and you turn the corner you go up

**[01:37:21]** corner and you turn the corner you go up

**[01:37:21]** corner and you turn the corner you go up the middle and off the end. And it was a

**[01:37:22]** the middle and off the end. And it was a

**[01:37:22]** the middle and off the end. And it was a race game of the kind that everybody

**[01:37:24]** race game of the kind that everybody

**[01:37:24]** race game of the kind that everybody knows from their own childhood. And some

**[01:37:26]** knows from their own childhood. And some

**[01:37:29]** squares which had rosettes on were the

**[01:37:29]** squares which had rosettes on were the safe squares or you had another throw

**[01:37:32]** safe squares or you had another throw

**[01:37:32]** safe squares or you had another throw and you could maybe put two on one

**[01:37:34]** and you could maybe put two on one

**[01:37:34]** and you could maybe put two on one square. We don't know. You could try and

**[01:37:35]** square. We don't know. You could try and

**[01:37:39]** block people and but anyway the crucial

**[01:37:39]** block people and but anyway the crucial thing is that the widespread

**[01:37:41]** thing is that the widespread

**[01:37:42]** thing is that the widespread distribution of this idiosyncratic shape

**[01:37:46]** and its lasting thing shows it must have

**[01:37:46]** and its lasting thing shows it must have been a very good game. Um if if people

**[01:37:51]** been a very good game. Um if if people

**[01:37:57]** were completely different games but

**[01:37:57]** were completely different games but probably not. So this is the thing it



### [01:38:00 - 01:39:00]

**[01:38:00]** probably not. So this is the thing it
