### [00:00 - 01:00]

**[00:00]** - The following is a conversation with Keyu Jin,

**[00:03]** an economist at the London School of Economics,

**[00:06]** specializing in China's economy,

**[00:08]** international macroeconomics, global trade imbalances,

**[00:11]** and financial policy.

**[00:13]** She wrote the highly lauded book on China titled

**[00:17]** "The New China Playbook: Beyond Socialism and Capitalism,"

**[00:22]** that details China's economic transformation

**[00:25]** since 1978 to today.

**[00:28]** And it dispels a lot of misconceptions about China's economy

**[00:32]** that people in the West have.

**[00:42]** And now, dear friends, here's Keyu Jin.

**[00:47]** What is the single biggest misconception the West has

**[00:50]** about China's economy today?

**[00:52]** - The biggest misunderstanding

**[00:54]** is somehow that a group of people, or even just one person,

**[00:58]** runs the entire Chinese economy.


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** It is far from the reality.

**[01:03]** It is a very complex, large economy.

**[01:06]** And even if there is an extreme form

**[01:08]** of political centralization,

**[01:10]** the economy is totally decentralized.

**[01:13]** The role that the local mayors,

**[01:15]** I call this the mayor economy, plays in reforms,

**[01:19]** but also driving the technological innovation

**[01:22]** that we're seeing right now,

**[01:24]** it is actually not run by just a handful of people.

**[01:27]** It's more decentralized than the US's.

**[01:29]** And I think more broadly,

**[01:31]** a big misunderstanding is really the relationship

**[01:34]** between Chinese people and authority.

**[01:36]** - Can you elaborate on that?

**[01:37]** - Well, people think that somehow

**[01:39]** there's almost blind submission to authority in China.

**[01:42]** We have a very nuanced relationship with authority,

**[01:46]** whether it is between kids and parents,

**[01:49]** or students and their teachers,

**[01:52]** or with your bosses and the Chinese government,

**[01:54]** it's kind of the same thing.

**[01:56]** There's paternalism,

**[01:58]** they think that they're responsible for you,


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:01]** but deference,

**[02:03]** a certain amount of deference to authority

**[02:05]** is not blind submission.

**[02:07]** It's been written in implicitly in our contract

**[02:09]** for thousands of years that in exchange for some deference,

**[02:14]** we are given stability, security,

**[02:18]** and peace, and hopefully, prosperity.

**[02:20]** - So there is some element that we have in the West

**[02:22]** of freedom of the individual,

**[02:24]** so that a little bit of the rebel is allowed

**[02:28]** imbalance with the difference to authority?

**[02:30]** - Yeah, absolutely.

**[02:31]** Without that,

**[02:32]** how can you have this radical,

**[02:34]** dynamic entrepreneurialism you see in China?

**[02:36]** If you don't have a sense of self,

**[02:39]** a sense of the fact that you can find opportunities,

**[02:43]** you look for opportunities, you drive opportunities,

**[02:47]** it's all self-motivated.

**[02:50]** - Is there still a young kid in China that's able to dream

**[02:54]** to be sort of the stereotypical Steve Jobs in the garage,

**[02:58]** start a business and change the world by doing so?


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:02]** - There are millions of young kids like that in China.

**[03:06]** They might not be thinking about changing the world,

**[03:08]** and this is where the Chinese approach to innovation

**[03:11]** is very different from the Silicon Valley one, I'd say.

**[03:14]** But they see opportunity.

**[03:15]** They see a country with a billion consumers.

**[03:19]** They see scale, they see speed,

**[03:22]** they see that with their dreams and the team

**[03:25]** that you have in China,

**[03:26]** with engineers, and the digital transformation,

**[03:28]** you can do so many things.

**[03:30]** And this generation of young people

**[03:32]** think about transforming their local economy.

**[03:34]** I think we're gonna get into this,

**[03:36]** but it's no longer gonna just be manufacturing.

**[03:39]** The young kids are entrepreneurs.

**[03:41]** - Well, let's stand the big picture,

**[03:43]** but there's a perception that China

**[03:46]** is a communist country.

**[03:48]** So to what degree is China a capitalist country

**[03:51]** and to what degree is it a communist country?

**[03:54]** - I've rarely seen a more capitalist society than China

**[03:58]** from the pure economic side.


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:02]** I've rarely seen companies that are as competitive

**[04:06]** as Chinese companies.

**[04:08]** People as ambitious and obsessed with making money

**[04:12]** as Chinese people.

**[04:14]** Kind of ruthless actually.

**[04:16]** And look, consumers shop, firms invest.

**[04:21]** If you invest well financially, you'll get great returns.

**[04:25]** What is not capitalistic about the Chinese economy?

**[04:28]** At the same time, the social fabric is highly socialist.

**[04:33]** First of all, the state or enterprises

**[04:35]** dominate many of the sectors.

**[04:36]** The state banks control the financial system.

**[04:39]** We often talk about common prosperity,

**[04:42]** about equal opportunity, just and fair society,

**[04:45]** but even daily stories,

**[04:47]** a walk in the park behind my my parents' apartment,

**[04:50]** you're gonna find at least 50 organized social groups

**[04:55]** on a daily level singing, dancing, exercising,

**[04:59]** doing whatever these fantastic idiosyncratic hobbies


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** they have, getting together every single day.

**[05:06]** And free courses for the elderly and retired.

**[05:09]** That sense of communalism, that sense of belonging,

**[05:13]** that strive for harmony at the societal level is there.

**[05:17]** - So just to go back to something you said,

**[05:20]** there is a value for competition culturally.

**[05:22]** So on the business side, on the economic side,

**[05:26]** there is sort of a cultural value

**[05:29]** of people competing in a meritocratic way.

**[05:33]** - Competition is ferocious in China,

**[05:35]** especially when it comes to Chinese companies,

**[05:38]** but also in education.

**[05:40]** I should be thankful that I'm not born later that I am,

**[05:44]** because I thought China was pretty competitive already

**[05:47]** going to the schools and studying for the exams.

**[05:49]** It is a different level today.

**[05:51]** Competition is not necessarily in the culture, I'd say.

**[05:55]** It's driven really by the economic

**[05:57]** and social circumstances of the day.


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** The Chinese companies are all hardworking.

**[06:02]** They're all going after the market share.

**[06:04]** They all kind of wanna do the same thing.

**[06:06]** It's not quite like in the US where you open a coffee shop,

**[06:09]** well, next door I'm gonna open a bagel shop, right?

**[06:14]** In China, the coffee shop does well,

**[06:15]** everybody wants to open the same coffee shop.

**[06:17]** And I think, again, I'm sure we're gonna get to this,

**[06:19]** but there's a lot of that kind of competition

**[06:22]** which really drives the world sometimes crazy

**[06:26]** of replication.

**[06:27]** But it's because it's not easy, right?

**[06:30]** It's not easy to make money.

**[06:31]** In education system,

**[06:33]** there are not enough jobs for the young people.

**[06:35]** So how do you get ahead?

**[06:38]** Let's say, if you're part of a lower stratum society,

**[06:40]** how are you gonna make sure that your children

**[06:43]** are gonna have a better life than you?

**[06:45]** You invest in education.

**[06:47]** So everything is about competition.

**[06:49]** In a country with 1.3 billion people,

**[06:51]** that's somewhat to be expected.

**[06:53]** - Let's go back to the roots of that.

**[06:55]** So you described the China's economy model

**[06:59]** is rooted in its history.


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** So can we talk about Confucianism?

**[07:02]** Can you explain to what degree those roots

**[07:05]** run back to Confucianism, and in general,

**[07:08]** to other parts of Chinese history?

**[07:10]** - Yeah, Confucianism is more of a moral philosophy

**[07:14]** than let's say religion or a belief system.

**[07:18]** It prioritizes social harmony above anything else.

**[07:25]** It's not about metaphysics, but more about ethics.

**[07:29]** And at the individual level, the responsibility,

**[07:33]** the duties are all meant to preserve that social order.

**[07:37]** So it's filial piety, it is loyalty,

**[07:41]** it is how to be a Chinese gentleman.

**[07:44]** But things like saving, frugality,

**[07:47]** is part of the moral discipline.

**[07:49]** Education is part of the moral cultivation.

**[07:53]** So there's a very strong emphasis that you as a citizen

**[07:57]** have a responsibility to contribute to society as a whole.


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** - On the education side,

**[08:04]** a part of Confucianism is a value for meritocracy.

**[08:07]** So how does that permeate the education system in China?

**[08:11]** You've already spoken to it a little bit,

**[08:13]** the value of competition in that

**[08:14]** it's already getting more and more intense.

**[08:16]** But it would be very interesting to get your understanding

**[08:19]** of the education system,

**[08:21]** its history, and as it stands today.

**[08:23]** - If China were relatively successful economically,

**[08:26]** a huge part of the reason is by and large

**[08:29]** it's been meritocratic.

**[08:31]** That is changing somewhat now.

**[08:33]** But the only way that you have

**[08:38]** still that many poor people,

**[08:39]** especially a couple decades back,

**[08:42]** still be in harmony with society,

**[08:45]** seeing all these rich people make tons of money

**[08:48]** and you're still belonging to that lower stratum,

**[08:51]** the only reason is that you believe

**[08:52]** that your children have a future through meritocracy.

**[08:56]** And even though it's imperfect,

**[08:58]** it's highly imperfect standardized testing,


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** all this competition,

**[09:01]** all of the hours and the tutorials

**[09:04]** to studying for standardized exams,

**[09:07]** well, that is a very realistic scenario in China,

**[09:11]** because there's that many people.

**[09:13]** When I was growing up in school, we had 60 people per class,

**[09:16]** and there were 10 classes in one grade.

**[09:18]** Now imagine that many people applying for colleges

**[09:25]** in the American way,

**[09:26]** how many essays would have been written

**[09:29]** and need to be scrutinized,

**[09:30]** but also that gives room for total corruption

**[09:34]** if you know what I mean, just connection-based.

**[09:36]** And actually the standardized exams,

**[09:38]** as imperfect as it is to select talent,

**[09:42]** is still by and large fair.

**[09:44]** And that's how that whole generation

**[09:48]** of entrepreneurs, bureaucrats,

**[09:51]** government officials were selective.

**[09:52]** You look at the Chinese premiers,

**[09:54]** the presidents of the past,

**[09:56]** they all went to great schools.

**[09:59]** A lot of them were engineers.


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** And same thing for civil servants.

**[10:03]** It has changed somewhat.

**[10:05]** The meritocracy I think is eroding in China.

**[10:07]** I'm worried about that because it is fine

**[10:10]** that you get into a good university based on your own merit,

**[10:13]** but finding a job now becomes much less meritocratic.

**[10:17]** People with connections get jobs more easily than others.

**[10:22]** Of course, this is not just a unique Chinese phenomenon,

**[10:24]** it's actually everywhere.

**[10:25]** But I guess what I'm saying is that that meritocracy,

**[10:28]** which was so fundamental to the Chinese,

**[10:30]** ancient Chinese education system, by the way,

**[10:33]** civil servants were selected

**[10:35]** based on standardized exams in the past.

**[10:37]** That's always been throughout Chinese history.

**[10:40]** And that relates to Confucianism.

**[10:42]** Now, the opportunities,

**[10:44]** and coming back to the competition point

**[10:46]** is that the opportunity's getting slimmer and slimmer.

**[10:49]** And again, this is not a unique Chinese phenomenon, jobs,

**[10:52]** where are the jobs gonna be, right?

**[10:54]** So meritocracy has become more of a problem.

**[10:58]** - Do you have any memories of your own experience


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** in terms of competition, the good and the bad of it?

**[11:03]** Maybe from that,

**[11:05]** can you pull out the thread of the value

**[11:07]** of that kind of competition?

**[11:09]** Basically, I grew up in the Soviet Union,

**[11:12]** so there's a kinda brutality to competition,

**[11:16]** but I think it ultimately molds really interesting people.

**[11:21]** - There is a good and bad part of competition.

**[11:24]** I remember when I was going into middle school,

**[11:26]** every single midterm exam, final exam,

**[11:30]** you are ranked from number one to number 800

**[11:33]** in your entire grade and publicly displayed.

**[11:37]** - [Lex] Nice.

**[11:37]** - Nice, right? - Very nice.

**[11:39]** - Imagine the majority of people and how they feel.

**[11:44]** But it does drive ambition in part.

**[11:48]** And you don't take anything for granted.

**[11:51]** And you work hard, you keep the spirit up.

**[11:56]** But going to the US,

**[11:59]** I finally realized that Americans are totally competitive.


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:01]** It's just that they don't display it.

**[12:03]** It's not as apparent.

**[12:05]** I remember I went to a very competitive high school,

**[12:07]** but everyone's like so chill, oh, I'm not studying, oh...

**[12:12]** They're studying, they are secretly studying.

**[12:16]** When I was doing my PhD at Harvard, people say,

**[12:18]** "Oh, my parents say don't work so hard."

**[12:21]** People say, "Don't say you worked."

**[12:23]** They're working hard, right?

**[12:25]** Just you don't show it.

**[12:27]** In China, it's kind of a noble thing

**[12:30]** to show that you're working hard,

**[12:32]** and that you're number one,

**[12:33]** or that you're top of the class and you wanna display it

**[12:35]** and you want to let everybody know.

**[12:38]** But in the US, everybody's like secretly doing it.

**[12:41]** - Yeah, some of is the signaling,

**[12:44]** the culture emphasizes the signaling

**[12:47]** is it better for everything to come easily,

**[12:52]** thereby showing that you're a genius it comes naturally,

**[12:55]** or is it better to show that you worked extremely hard

**[12:58]** for the thing,

**[12:59]** but the ultimate result is there's still competition.


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:01]** But I don't know, when you're visually displaying

**[13:04]** and explicitly stating that it's good

**[13:09]** to be number one and it's bad to be number 800,

**[13:12]** I think that permeates throughout the culture

**[13:15]** to where you understand,

**[13:18]** first of all, you understand that hard work is the only way

**[13:21]** to improve, to succeed in life.

**[13:26]** And second of all,

**[13:27]** you just create this framework of early on understanding

**[13:32]** what it means to live a good life.

**[13:33]** And a part of that is to find the thing you're damn good at

**[13:40]** and get even better at it, master it,

**[13:44]** become hopefully the best person in the world at that thing.

**[13:47]** I dunno, that's an ex extremely important lesson

**[13:50]** for society to teach.

**[13:51]** - That's the right, I would say,

**[13:53]** the right kind of competition

**[13:54]** or the efficient kind of competition.

**[13:56]** I feel that in the Chinese education system,

**[13:59]** it was not necessarily efficient


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** because it kind of frames you and molds you to be thinking

**[14:04]** in a certain way, what's been taught to you.

**[14:07]** You don't have the bandwidth, or the time,

**[14:09]** or creative freedom to be more creative

**[14:11]** and to think outside the box.

**[14:12]** There it's just the box.

**[14:14]** You maximize the box and that's it.

**[14:17]** You don't actually know what's outside of the box,

**[14:18]** and you never actually go there.

**[14:20]** That's the bad part of Chinese competition.

**[14:22]** And when I got to the US,

**[14:24]** the high school teachers were asking us

**[14:27]** to question authority to question text.

**[14:30]** I'm like, "Wow, really?

**[14:31]** You can do that?"

**[14:32]** So I started asking why.

**[14:34]** - All right, so there has been this miracle

**[14:37]** in the Chinese economy from after Mao

**[14:41]** under Deng Xiaoping where the Chinese economy

**[14:44]** got transformed and grew incredibly.

**[14:47]** So can you explain what happened?

**[14:49]** The different transformations that happened,

**[14:51]** the different reforms that happened under Deng Xiaoping.

**[14:56]** - Deng Xiaoping was by far our most pragmatic leader.

**[14:59]** And I think everybody's grateful to Deng Xiaoping.


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:03]** My father's generation would not have seen

**[15:07]** that amount of prosperity and peace and opportunity

**[15:10]** without Deng Xiaoping.

**[15:12]** It started in the late 1970s when Deng Xiaoping

**[15:15]** came out with this open up and reform mandate,

**[15:19]** and it was very tough.

**[15:21]** Again, coming back to the big misunderstanding of China,

**[15:23]** it's not as if one leader decides

**[15:25]** that that's what we're gonna do

**[15:26]** and then everybody follows order and does that.

**[15:28]** No, there are tons of political barriers,

**[15:31]** tons of incentive, compatibility problems

**[15:34]** at the local level.

**[15:35]** In the end, you need the local provincial governors,

**[15:39]** the mayors to do the job.

**[15:41]** And how many perfectas are there in China, right?

**[15:45]** A lot.

**[15:46]** And they have their own interests, right?

**[15:49]** We know this around the world,

**[15:51]** politically, it's the most difficult thing to do.

**[15:53]** But somehow Deng Xiaoping was able to break tradition,

**[15:57]** break convention,

**[15:59]** come out with this completely new way of thinking


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:03]** about society, life, and economy.

**[16:05]** And it was so transformative.

**[16:08]** I remember people of that generation told me one time

**[16:12]** that society was gonna focus on the economy.

**[16:17]** Really? Why would they do that?

**[16:20]** Wasn't it politics?

**[16:21]** Wasn't it everything about politics,

**[16:23]** and struggle, and ideology?

**[16:25]** So for them that the whole country

**[16:27]** and the government's gonna focus on the economy

**[16:29]** was just so shocking.

**[16:32]** Even though we take it for granted now,

**[16:34]** that shows you that breaking that mold

**[16:38]** was incredibly difficult.

**[16:40]** But I think opening up was a really momentous thing

**[16:47]** that China did.

**[16:48]** And it wasn't just joining the deputy army,

**[16:49]** I mean, they were doing a decade of work in preparation

**[16:52]** leading up to that,

**[16:54]** what's called special economic zone

**[16:56]** is really to turn Shenzhen from a fishing village

**[16:59]** to an export platform


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:00]** now to a Chinese style Silicon Valley, right?

**[17:04]** And there was the agricultural reform in the 1980s

**[17:08]** that meant that farmers could decide

**[17:09]** what they were gonna grow and keep the surplus,

**[17:12]** whereas it was a collective system before,

**[17:15]** you know that very well.

**[17:17]** And then of course,

**[17:18]** the ultimate transformation was when China actually joined

**[17:22]** the WTO in 2001, and the rest was history, right?

**[17:26]** We're still talking about the aftermath.

**[17:29]** But reforms was the single biggest impetus

**[17:33]** to Chinese growth.

**[17:35]** And every time there was a major reform,

**[17:37]** it was followed by a good decade long growth.

**[17:41]** Every time growth went down,

**[17:42]** there was a new series of major reforms rolled out.

**[17:46]** And then, oops, that led to another wave of good growth.

**[17:51]** But I'd say that reform pace has slowed

**[17:55]** in the last 15 years.

**[17:58]** But are there reforms to be done?


### [18:00 - 19:00]

**[18:00]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[18:02]** Has China reached even close to its potential?

**[18:05]** Not at all.

**[18:07]** But again, it comes back to politics.

**[18:10]** Right now it's less about economics,

**[18:12]** it's more about national security,

**[18:13]** it's more about politics.

**[18:14]** And I think that is probably the single biggest barrier

**[18:17]** to continued good economic growth,

**[18:20]** - Maybe, can you speak to what it takes

**[18:22]** in such a large system in many ways,

**[18:24]** such a successful economy to do reform?

**[18:27]** So you mentioned pragmatism.

**[18:28]** Deng Xiaoping famously said that

**[18:30]** "It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white,

**[18:32]** as long as it catches mice."

**[18:34]** So there's that pragmatism

**[18:36]** that I think underlies a lot of great reforms.

**[18:39]** - As a contrast to Soviet Union, the Chinese economy,

**[18:44]** as I mentioned, was extremely decentralized.

**[18:46]** In Soviet Union,

**[18:47]** the ministries were in charge of essential bureaucracy,

**[18:51]** but a lot of the power were given

**[18:53]** to these provincial governors, party secretaries,

**[18:56]** mayors of different sorts.

**[18:58]** And they were incentivized.


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:00]** That's the key,

**[19:01]** is that these mayors were incentivized to do a good job.

**[19:04]** If I were successful on a radical reform,

**[19:07]** if I were successful, I'd be a national hero.

**[19:11]** And then that reform will be rolled out in every single city

**[19:14]** in the country over time.

**[19:16]** And I'll be promoted to the higher run

**[19:18]** of the central government.

**[19:19]** And who knows, I might even become vice premier,

**[19:23]** premier president one day.

**[19:25]** That was how the individual was motivated

**[19:28]** to carry out these really tough reforms.

**[19:31]** Now, China has changed a bit, right?

**[19:35]** It's not about being radical and radically successful.

**[19:39]** It's about being safe, right?

**[19:41]** So when you shift from basically an entrepreneurial state

**[19:45]** to a safe state,

**[19:47]** then the objective function changes

**[19:49]** and you see it in different economic outcomes.

**[19:54]** - So maybe can you speak to that.

**[19:55]** What are some important things to understand

**[19:58]** about the structure of the Chinese state?


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:00]** - Well, the central leadership politically

**[20:03]** is extremely powerful and it's very consolidated.

**[20:06]** But they hold a very crucial key to the local governments,

**[20:09]** which is that they decide their fate.

**[20:11]** Am I gonna promote them? Am I gonna put them in jail?

**[20:14]** Am I going to fire them? Am I going to reward them?

**[20:16]** Am I gonna punish them?

**[20:18]** They hold that crucial key.

**[20:19]** And I think what was very surprising

**[20:23]** for most of the Western audience

**[20:26]** is that when I mentioned about the mayor economy,

**[20:28]** there's like,

**[20:29]** why don't our American mayors in each city

**[20:31]** do these very radical things, and then push for GDP growth,

**[20:35]** and technology innovation?

**[20:37]** It's quite different.

**[20:38]** I think this is where China's very unique in the world,

**[20:41]** is that political centralization, economic decentralization,

**[20:45]** and the yardstick

**[20:46]** to measure local mayor's competence through,

**[20:51]** in the first stage it was GDP growth.

**[20:53]** So I am a mayor of the city of Nanjing in Jiangsu province.

**[20:58]** I'm gonna like peak at my neighbor's mayor's


### [21:00 - 22:00]

**[21:02]** city's GDP growth.

**[21:03]** And I'm gonna be very, very competitive.

**[21:05]** By the way, I forgot about that,

**[21:06]** competition is extremely competitive

**[21:08]** among the local government officials

**[21:11]** because you are competing with other mayor

**[21:13]** for a top job, right?

**[21:14]** So you need to do better than them.

**[21:16]** And whether that was efficient structure or not,

**[21:21]** I cannot comment,

**[21:22]** but is certainly just fueled this massive

**[21:26]** and rapid expansion, economic expansion.

**[21:29]** First it was industrialization.

**[21:31]** Everybody wanted to do exports.

**[21:33]** Then they discovered,

**[21:34]** "Oh my gosh, we can have so much fiscal revenues

**[21:37]** coming from land, right?

**[21:38]** Selling land.

**[21:39]** Let's build real estate and let's urbanize."

**[21:43]** And then the money kept coming in to these local governments

**[21:47]** and that they can spend it

**[21:48]** on nurturing more companies, or supporting real estate,

**[21:51]** or supporting investment and they can do a better job.

**[21:54]** So then it was geared towards real estate,

**[21:57]** and that's how the property cycle became the big thing.


### [22:00 - 23:00]

**[22:00]** Everything was at double speed

**[22:03]** because of what the local government's incentives

**[22:07]** were designed to do.

**[22:08]** I say now that China's biggest challenge

**[22:11]** is consumption, right?

**[22:12]** It's not production.

**[22:13]** We know that China's very, very competitive in production,

**[22:15]** in supply.

**[22:16]** China needs to be a consuming country to be a rich country.

**[22:19]** Why don't you put consumption as part of the yardstick

**[22:22]** for measuring local governments?

**[22:24]** For a while it was environmental protection.

**[22:26]** Guess what?

**[22:27]** Very few of them really wanna do it seriously,

**[22:29]** because it goes against the incentives

**[22:32]** of driving growth, right?

**[22:34]** They would suffer on GDP growth if they were very serious

**[22:37]** about environmental protection.

**[22:38]** So for a couple years,

**[22:40]** nothing happened in China on that front.

**[22:42]** And then the central government got really kind of concerned

**[22:46]** and even angry and frustrated.

**[22:48]** So they decided to put that as a penalizing factor.

**[22:52]** And then guess what happened?

**[22:53]** Well, actually environmental protection sped up.

**[22:56]** And in the matter of short few years,

**[22:59]** I see blue skies every day in Beijing.


### [23:00 - 24:00]

**[23:01]** That's how it works.

**[23:03]** - So GDP is a measure of success in production.

**[23:07]** What's the measure or what does it mean to be successful

**[23:11]** on the consumer side?

**[23:12]** You said it's important to improve that.

**[23:14]** What does it mean to be a successful consumer nation?

**[23:17]** - The metrics shouldn't be geared just towards growth alone.

**[23:21]** GDP growth alone.

**[23:22]** It was just singular GDP growth,

**[23:24]** and you can borrow heavily and just spend on infrastructure.

**[23:28]** That's not a productive way to drive the economy.

**[23:30]** And that's what the local governments were doing

**[23:33]** for a long period of time.

**[23:35]** In the last few years, innovation,

**[23:37]** unicorns have kind of been an implicit yardstick

**[23:41]** for local governments.

**[23:41]** That's kind of how we've seen these great EV companies,

**[23:46]** 80 cities doing EVs.

**[23:47]** I mean, do we really need a 80 cities

**[23:49]** to do their own EVs, right?

**[23:51]** Solar panels.

**[23:52]** Now, DeepSeek has become a star.

**[23:55]** Semiconductor companies,

**[23:57]** each local government wants to have their own

**[23:59]** national champion.


### [24:00 - 25:00]

**[24:01]** So implicitly technology

**[24:03]** was part of the yardstick competition as well.

**[24:06]** But if you can more accurately have a metric

**[24:10]** for consumption measures,

**[24:11]** really focus on making sure that it's coming

**[24:14]** from consumption, this GDP growth,

**[24:16]** rather than from investment or infrastructure,

**[24:18]** then I think that it might focus the government's objective

**[24:23]** a bit more on thinking about

**[24:25]** how to make people feel more secure

**[24:28]** so that they wanna save more.

**[24:30]** For instance, creating more jobs,

**[24:31]** for instance, more on social security spending

**[24:34]** on healthcare, on elderly care.

**[24:37]** Because for the longest period of time,

**[24:39]** this political economy model was brilliant

**[24:41]** as scaling up supply,

**[24:43]** but it was extremely weak at raising personal consumption

**[24:46]** because the incentive does not lie in consumption,

**[24:48]** it lies in production.

**[24:50]** So you shift the objectives a little bit,

**[24:52]** and maybe local government will do more

**[24:55]** to stimulate consumption.

**[24:56]** - Okay.

**[24:57]** You mentioned the mayor economy.

**[24:59]** That seems like an incredibly powerful idea.


### [25:00 - 26:00]

**[25:01]** And you also mentioned that perhaps you're not sure

**[25:05]** exactly how perfectly efficient it is

**[25:07]** and what efficiency there means.

**[25:09]** How good are you at quickly figuring out the best ideas?

**[25:14]** That's what an efficient market does.

**[25:16]** There's a kind of component to what you're saying

**[25:18]** where you're a little bit critical of do you really need

**[25:22]** EV companies, but maybe you do.

**[25:23]** That seems like an incredible thing to do, right?

**[25:26]** So what are the pros and cons of this?

**[25:28]** Maybe you could speak to it a little bit more.

**[25:29]** - I think it depends on the timing.

**[25:32]** If you're starting something,

**[25:34]** starting a new emerging strategic sector like EVs,

**[25:37]** or batteries, or solar panels,

**[25:39]** you need the local governments to be involved

**[25:42]** to mobilize, right?

**[25:44]** The big push to coordinate the supply chains.

**[25:47]** If you wait for the markets to develop over time,

**[25:49]** it's gonna take a long time.

**[25:50]** Maybe they don't even wanna do it, right?

**[25:52]** Look at the US.

**[25:53]** The US is very, very behind

**[25:54]** on some of the new strategic sectors.

**[25:56]** But once you've reached a certain level


### [26:00 - 27:00]

**[26:00]** of market competition,

**[26:02]** I think the state needs to withdraw or to retreat.

**[26:07]** Because ultimately the state is not the best

**[26:10]** at allocating resources.

**[26:12]** Picking winners.

**[26:14]** You want the private actors, whether it's the venture funds,

**[26:17]** or through market competition

**[26:19]** to ultimately decide who gets the most resources.

**[26:22]** But in the beginning,

**[26:23]** that big push is not really in any of the canonical models

**[26:27]** that I've studied in economics

**[26:28]** in the Western school of thought;

**[26:30]** state push, state mobilization, state initiation.

**[26:33]** That's not there.

**[26:35]** But I think if you look at EVs, solar panels,

**[26:38]** even just thinking about the idea of reforms

**[26:40]** in the first place, that state push was vitally important.

**[26:46]** The other negative,

**[26:49]** although I think by and large positive aspect

**[26:53]** is I don't think that we need 80 cities

**[26:56]** to do their own EV brands,

**[26:58]** but to get started,


### [27:00 - 28:00]

**[27:00]** maybe that's what it would've taken to drive that incentive.

**[27:04]** And then ultimately it's up to the market to decide

**[27:07]** who are the last five remaining EV companies, right?

**[27:09]** Through market mechanisms.

**[27:11]** That's Chinese style industrial policy.

**[27:13]** Industrial policy was heavily criticized.

**[27:15]** And again, if I talk to my Harvard professors,

**[27:19]** they'll be very, very, very skeptical about the role

**[27:23]** of the state, especially in such a major way.

**[27:27]** But if you look at the Chinese experience,

**[27:29]** the evidence for success is all there.

**[27:31]** The cities that have pushed the most on supporting

**[27:35]** that particular sector,

**[27:36]** ultimately did the best in terms of production,

**[27:38]** but also in terms of innovation measured by patents.

**[27:41]** It's all in the data.

**[27:43]** But the downside is that a lot of the capital is wasted.

**[27:48]** And this is what I also discussed in my book,

**[27:49]** is that it is inefficient,

**[27:52]** although maybe it's necessary.

**[27:54]** The amount of waste of investment

**[27:57]** plowed into these companies

**[27:59]** that will ultimately just go under,


### [28:00 - 29:00]

**[28:02]** but also the misallocation of resources,

**[28:04]** because it's led by the state, are some of the downsides.

**[28:07]** But I guess on balance,

**[28:09]** it's been positive

**[28:10]** because look at China's internal combustion engine effort.

**[28:14]** Nothing, right?

**[28:16]** Semiconductors;

**[28:17]** thanks to Biden, thanks to Trump,

**[28:19]** it's improved dramatically.

**[28:21]** But all these things that they tried to do before

**[28:24]** they couldn't do.

**[28:25]** But when it's a new thing,

**[28:26]** like something that there's no incumbent,

**[28:29]** no particular advantage in any country,

**[28:32]** actually, China's really spearheading these sectors.

**[28:34]** - Can we linger a little bit more in this mayor economy?

**[28:36]** It just seems like such a powerful thing

**[28:40]** where one mayor looks over to the next

**[28:42]** and looks even just a trivially simple number

**[28:45]** like the GDP.

**[28:46]** Why don't we do that in the United States

**[28:48]** or in the West more, just compete on GDP?

**[28:52]** - Well, you need to be elected and reelected, right?

**[28:55]** Is that what your electoral base cares about?

**[28:59]** In China it's what the central government,


### [29:00 - 30:00]

**[29:02]** your boss cares about.

**[29:03]** If you ask the consumers,

**[29:04]** they'd rather you spend on social spending, right?

**[29:07]** The things we talked about that stimulates consumption

**[29:09]** on education, on healthcare,

**[29:11]** things that stimulate demand.

**[29:13]** So it's the difference of political system.

**[29:18]** - So maybe can you speak to the difference,

**[29:20]** another difference is the long term

**[29:23]** multi-generational thinking that permeate Chinese culture.

**[29:27]** So how does that differ from the West,

**[29:29]** sort of the Western style capitalism

**[29:31]** of quarterly focused thinking?

**[29:35]** - The Chinese are both the most patient

**[29:38]** and the most short-termist economic actors I met.

**[29:45]** The patience I don't need to explain

**[29:46]** because I think the political continuity

**[29:50]** means that they can make plans for two decades ahead, right?

**[29:54]** Even longer.

**[29:56]** The investment of Chinese parents in their children


### [30:00 - 31:00]

**[30:00]** is a multi-decade long project.

**[30:04]** And they save, Chinese people love to save,

**[30:07]** because they think that they'll have even more money

**[30:10]** if they save that money rather than spend it

**[30:12]** on a ski vacation.

**[30:13]** So that I think it's patently obvious to most people

**[30:18]** around the world,

**[30:20]** but I think that most of them would not have known

**[30:23]** that there's a very popular motto in China

**[30:26]** which is called short, flat, fast.

**[30:29]** That's the impatient part of the Chinese culture,

**[30:32]** especially with respect to the economy.

**[30:35]** Short, flat, fast was used

**[30:38]** to describe a winning volleyball strategy

**[30:40]** that eventually became adapted to describing the society

**[30:43]** as a whole and economic decision-making.

**[30:46]** If you're an investor,

**[30:47]** you only wanna invest in things

**[30:49]** that you can quickly turn around and make a lot of money

**[30:51]** and don't need to do much work.

**[30:53]** It also applies to marriages.

**[30:55]** So a short courtship,

**[30:57]** a very flat emotional relationship, and a fast divorce.


### [31:00 - 32:00]

**[31:01]** (both laughing)

**[31:02]** That is how you see these companies rise

**[31:07]** within a very short period of time.

**[31:10]** Of course, investors are only interested in those companies

**[31:12]** that can turnaround and exit in a very short period of time,

**[31:16]** making many, many multiples.

**[31:18]** And so in that sense,

**[31:20]** people are very, very impatient, right?

**[31:23]** I sit on some boards of these longstanding companies,

**[31:27]** and the values are just so different,

**[31:31]** even though a lot of these public companies are constrained

**[31:34]** by the quarterly results and so forth.

**[31:36]** But the values are about sustaining something,

**[31:40]** a company for a long time thinking about organic growth,

**[31:44]** thinking about investments for the future, sustainability.

**[31:48]** Maybe it's that competition,

**[31:50]** maybe it's the speed that we're used to in China,

**[31:53]** people think about short.

**[31:55]** So this dichotomy is very, very interesting.

**[31:58]** - That's surprising to me.


### [32:00 - 33:00]

**[32:00]** - Yeah, well, it is.

**[32:01]** - It's a surprising idea, right?

**[32:02]** So that there is a kind of, in the West,

**[32:05]** conception of Chinese culture, Chinese economy,

**[32:08]** that everything is 50, 100, 200 years out,

**[32:12]** you have this long vision.

**[32:14]** But you're basically saying that there's a deep

**[32:17]** in the business sector impatience about everything.

**[32:20]** - That's a transitory phenomenon, I'd say.

**[32:23]** But if you look at the cheaper stuff, poor quality,

**[32:27]** that's a reflection of the copying,

**[32:28]** it's the same kind of mentality.

**[32:30]** Just get ahead quickly.

**[32:31]** But again, that is all shifting.

**[32:34]** That is all shifting because China's now

**[32:37]** in a different stage of development.

**[32:39]** If you ask the younger generation,

**[32:41]** they really care about quality.

**[32:43]** They care about values.

**[32:44]** And these companies, these very successful companies,

**[32:47]** successful in five years, 10 years,

**[32:49]** found themselves in a very difficult position

**[32:51]** after a longer period of time.

**[32:53]** So that short, flat, fast attitude, which was so popular,

**[32:57]** especially before the pandemic,

**[32:59]** that's actually somewhat disappearing.


### [33:00 - 34:00]

**[33:01]** So in some sense,

**[33:02]** this economic downturn is not that bad for China

**[33:05]** because it made the Chinese realize

**[33:07]** that it's not always gonna go up.

**[33:09]** And it made them really look down deeper

**[33:12]** into what they really should be focused on.

**[33:15]** That there will be cycles, there will be up and downs.

**[33:18]** And so these very short termist thinking

**[33:21]** and opportunistic way of driving business

**[33:25]** will ultimately fail.

**[33:28]** It's bad for China

**[33:29]** that we're having a sustained economic softness,

**[33:33]** sustained economic softness.

**[33:35]** But I think it's also a very, very important lesson

**[33:38]** for the Chinese people to go through.

**[33:41]** - Let's go, if we can, a bit to the personal.

**[33:43]** So you grew up in China.

**[33:45]** What are some moments from childhood

**[33:46]** that were maybe defining to your understanding

**[33:50]** of Chinese culture and Chinese economy?

**[33:54]** - We look back at those moments when everybody in China

**[33:58]** was very poor with a bit of nostalgia.


### [34:00 - 35:00]

**[34:02]** I remember no doors were locked.

**[34:04]** I was in Beijing,

**[34:06]** and I remember every day in the summer,

**[34:10]** everybody just went downstairs

**[34:12]** and chatted with everybody else.

**[34:15]** It was very social, it was very community-based.

**[34:18]** The neighbors help each other.

**[34:20]** We had very, very little, small apartments,

**[34:24]** very limited access to certain goods.

**[34:26]** When I was born, even in Beijing,

**[34:28]** there were these vouchers for how many eggs you can buy.

**[34:33]** And even Beijing,

**[34:34]** there were three or four blackouts per week, typically.

**[34:38]** There was a sense of community,

**[34:40]** there was a very strong bond between people

**[34:44]** and within the family because they were going

**[34:46]** after a common goal, making your life better, right?

**[34:48]** Struggling, striving to make your life better.

**[34:51]** And I remember being on the back of my father's bike,

**[34:55]** getting up 6:00 AM every day and going to nursery.


### [35:00 - 36:00]

**[35:00]** And that's the typical day.

**[35:03]** Not a lot of material goods,

**[35:04]** but people had a sense of purpose.

**[35:06]** And that's radically a different,

**[35:11]** it's completely different now in China.

**[35:13]** - Do you think that if you go to the human condition,

**[35:16]** do you think that nostalgia has some truth to it,

**[35:18]** or is it just nostalgia like any other?

**[35:20]** Is there some aspect of our intense, competitive,

**[35:25]** vibrant economy that loses some element?

**[35:28]** - Absolutely.

**[35:29]** - [Lex] Of everybody being poured together?

**[35:32]** - Well, everybody having a common goal

**[35:35]** and a sense of community

**[35:37]** that is what's missing in these extremely individual-based

**[35:40]** capital societies.

**[35:41]** And I think what the Chinese government is striving to do

**[35:45]** with Chinese socialistic characteristics

**[35:48]** is to somehow try to preserve

**[35:50]** a bit of that socialist character

**[35:52]** while still relying on market-based incentives.

**[35:56]** But if you're an extremely in individual based society,

**[35:59]** I think you do lose a lot of that.


### [36:00 - 37:00]

**[36:02]** And I think some of the backlash that we're seeing

**[36:05]** from society is a reflection of that, right?

**[36:08]** People being alone more and more,

**[36:11]** the death of despair in the US,

**[36:15]** addiction, they're lonely, right?

**[36:19]** And competition means that you kind of have

**[36:22]** to be somewhat badass,

**[36:24]** and you sometimes put down values and you forsake harmony

**[36:30]** in order to get ahead.

**[36:31]** That's certainly the Chinese society now,

**[36:33]** that was not the case before.

**[36:35]** - You think that's the natural consequence

**[36:37]** of capitalism almost always,

**[36:39]** that you become more individualized, you become lonelier,

**[36:43]** you feel lesser if you are not winning?

**[36:48]** And thereby somehow that breaks down society,

**[36:52]** community more and more?

**[36:54]** - I think it's a spectrum, right?

**[36:56]** And Europe is somewhere in between, I'd say.


### [37:00 - 38:00]

**[37:01]** But Europe also is not as technologically

**[37:04]** and innovative as the US,

**[37:06]** but on a social level,

**[37:08]** there is more social protection for the people.

**[37:10]** There is a stronger sense of community, I'd argue.

**[37:14]** It's not perfect.

**[37:15]** Ultimately it is a choice.

**[37:17]** And this is what I think that China has to decide, right?

**[37:20]** Do you want technological supremacy

**[37:22]** and radical breakthroughs?

**[37:24]** Well, yes.

**[37:25]** If you do, then you have to tolerate

**[37:26]** that there are gonna be some people

**[37:28]** who are just gonna be uncomfortably rich

**[37:33]** like in the United States.

**[37:34]** You can't say that you detest the financial system

**[37:38]** for its greed,

**[37:39]** but then not accept the fact

**[37:41]** that it is what fuels innovation, right?

**[37:45]** Risky capital fuels uncertain investments,

**[37:50]** which allows for countries like the United States

**[37:53]** to be making these breakthroughs.

**[37:55]** That's what China wants.

**[37:56]** But at the same time,

**[37:57]** China can't tolerate these extremely rich people around


### [38:00 - 39:00]

**[38:01]** and their power that is accrue to them.

**[38:04]** They want to be a leader in technology,

**[38:08]** but then the financial system is not liberalized.

**[38:11]** It's highly regulated,

**[38:13]** but there's also intervention.

**[38:16]** Even if we look back at the French civil law

**[38:19]** versus the English common law,

**[38:22]** well, the former protects creditors,

**[38:26]** and the latter is more friendly towards debtors,

**[38:29]** which gives them more breathing space to innovate,

**[38:32]** but also to fail, and to innovate again,

**[38:34]** and makes a big difference.

**[38:36]** So it's all about a spectrum, right?

**[38:39]** But you can't have it both ways.

**[38:41]** - We don't often enough have that nationwide conversation

**[38:45]** about what we wanna be as a country.

**[38:47]** There's just a group of people yelling,

**[38:50]** we don't want billionaires,

**[38:51]** and another group saying we don't want communists

**[38:55]** or whatever.

**[38:56]** It's a very trivialized kind of chanting.

**[38:58]** But there is a balance, there is a spectrum,


### [39:00 - 40:00]

**[39:00]** and you get to decide,

**[39:03]** do you like the nice things, the nice toys?

**[39:07]** - And the power that the US has?

**[39:09]** - And the power, the geopolitical power, the military power,

**[39:12]** cultural power, influence on the rest of the world?

**[39:14]** Yeah, you get to choose which do you want?

**[39:19]** So the first time you went to US, what was that like?

**[39:23]** Mentioned Harvard,

**[39:24]** how did that change your understanding of the world?

**[39:27]** - Well, it's funny that we're talking about this now

**[39:30]** because I was able to go to the US on a scholarship

**[39:33]** to an American high school because the US at that time

**[39:36]** was open arms, all open arms towards international students.

**[39:40]** They kind of wanted to be the country that was going

**[39:44]** to educate the future leaders of the world.

**[39:48]** And their elitist in institutions like Harvard

**[39:52]** was really gonna be they're the center of the world.

**[39:54]** So they welcomed students like me

**[39:57]** and many, many others to be exchange students


### [40:00 - 41:00]

**[40:00]** to study in the US.

**[40:02]** And we thought,

**[40:03]** "Wow, we've never seen a more generous country."

**[40:08]** And I was able to go to high school,

**[40:12]** an American high school and live with an American family,

**[40:14]** which was, wow, can I say a big change from China.

**[40:20]** Not only because I was plucked

**[40:21]** from the Communist Youth League Party

**[40:25]** and then straight to supporting their Democratic campaign

**[40:27]** because the host family was running

**[40:29]** for state attorney general in New York.

**[40:31]** So I was kind of going to these conventions

**[40:33]** and handing out flyers and trying to get votes,

**[40:35]** and I don't know, in Chinatown or something.

**[40:39]** But it was so interesting

**[40:42]** to see that's how the system worked.

**[40:44]** But in the course of doing that,

**[40:47]** I realized that people had a very simplistic understanding

**[40:50]** about China.

**[40:51]** And that's probably, even when I was 14,

**[40:56]** I decided that one thing I wanted to do

**[40:59]** was to dispel some of these deep myths about China,


### [41:00 - 42:00]

**[41:04]** because the China that they knew,

**[41:06]** and again, it was all the three T's back in the late 1990s,

**[41:10]** Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square.

**[41:15]** They thought about China,

**[41:16]** they thought about these three things.

**[41:18]** And I was like,

**[41:18]** well, that's strange because that's not how I'm feeling

**[41:22]** in China with all this bidding for the Olympics before 2000,

**[41:27]** and all these buildings going up and down,

**[41:29]** all this excitement about joining the WTO

**[41:33]** on these radical reforms that are taking place.

**[41:37]** And then all this effervescence that you feel in the air,

**[41:40]** it's not GDP growth as numbers, you actually see it.

**[41:43]** I said, this is really,

**[41:45]** and they're describing China

**[41:46]** as if it was a place shredded white terror.

**[41:50]** And so I thought, "Hmm, that's interesting.

**[41:52]** There's a big gap, big gap of understanding."

**[41:56]** And even today, that many years later,


### [42:00 - 43:00]

**[42:02]** people know China a little bit more,

**[42:03]** but the sentiment hasn't profoundly changed.

**[42:06]** - It's still the three T's, I feel like.

**[42:08]** (both laughing)

**[42:09]** - Some variation of that.

**[42:11]** - So what about the level of misunderstanding

**[42:13]** of Chinese people of the West?

**[42:16]** Is there a similar level of misunderstanding

**[42:18]** the other direction as well?

**[42:20]** - I don't think to the same extent,

**[42:22]** because there's Hollywood, they can see daily American life,

**[42:26]** although it might not be total realistic.

**[42:31]** There was a huge amount of admiration

**[42:34]** of US technology innovation, but also the American dream.

**[42:41]** I think our newspapers, even though there's bias everywhere,

**[42:45]** is not focused only on reporting the really bad stuff

**[42:49]** and portraying a negative side.

**[42:51]** I think these few years have been a little bit different,

**[42:53]** but so many students went to the US, right?

**[42:57]** So many people traveled to the US.

**[42:59]** And this is an interesting thing.


### [43:00 - 44:00]

**[43:02]** I rarely met an American who has been to China

**[43:08]** and who still goes on about how bad China is.

**[43:12]** I think that going to China makes all the difference.

**[43:16]** - I feel that's like one of the big gaps of my life

**[43:18]** that I need to alleviate is to travel in a real way

**[43:22]** for a long time to really experience

**[43:24]** the people and the cultures.

**[43:26]** And China's a big place.

**[43:28]** - Go dig deep and don't just go to Beijing and Shanghai.

**[43:33]** - Let's go back to the economics.

**[43:34]** So can you just dig a little deeper on the relationship

**[43:40]** in China between the government and the companies

**[43:42]** in the private sector?

**[43:44]** So how much freedom do companies have?

**[43:48]** - Another big misunderstanding and a fundamental one

**[43:51]** is that people somehow think that the state

**[43:54]** suppresses the private sector.

**[43:56]** It's not at all as simple as that.


### [44:00 - 45:00]

**[44:00]** For the most part,

**[44:01]** if we look at the local government's incentive system,

**[44:03]** they wanna help the best private companies

**[44:06]** which are the most promising,

**[44:08]** because it makes them look good.

**[44:09]** It adds to their GDP, it adds to the jobs investment.

**[44:13]** They are so helpful to these private companies.

**[44:15]** Actually, I know many of these local government officials

**[44:19]** working tirelessly day and night,

**[44:21]** especially in bad times to coordinate

**[44:25]** between debtors and creditors and to kind of smooth out

**[44:28]** and define relationships with banks.

**[44:31]** They wanna help these private companies because, again,

**[44:33]** their incentives are aligned.

**[44:36]** DeepSeek is private company, by the way.

**[44:39]** So it has done the country proud.

**[44:42]** And why would the state wanna go

**[44:44]** and suppress these private companies

**[44:46]** which ultimately is kind of represents a beacon success

**[44:50]** for China?

**[44:52]** Now, on how much freedom they have,

**[44:54]** it's really ranged from too much freedom,

**[44:58]** that's part of the problem,


### [45:00 - 46:00]

**[45:00]** where you have defense companies buying art auction houses,

**[45:03]** real estate companies like Evergrande buying soccer clubs,

**[45:07]** doing EVs,

**[45:10]** companies investing in real estate that has nothing to do

**[45:14]** with their core business.

**[45:15]** That's how much latitude were given to private companies.

**[45:18]** And there were consequences.

**[45:21]** They were not reigned in.

**[45:22]** And then you go to the other extremes where they're scolded,

**[45:26]** there reprimanded, they're reigned in,

**[45:28]** and they're kind of folded into submission.

**[45:30]** So that is the whole spectrum.

**[45:32]** You have the whole range.

**[45:34]** But I guess what we're really getting at is it is a country

**[45:38]** that is moving from a no rule of law

**[45:42]** or very little rule of law, very immature markets,

**[45:45]** to something that is being gradually established.

**[45:51]** Bankruptcy laws, corruption laws,

**[45:55]** rules and regulations on what's possible.

**[45:58]** One interesting point is that in China,


### [46:00 - 47:00]

**[46:03]** you ask the companies to innovate first

**[46:06]** and then you re regulate after, right?

**[46:09]** So that has led to things like P to P platforms,

**[46:13]** it's led to lots of kind of financial innovations,

**[46:16]** some of which has actually been very helpful and good,

**[46:20]** some of which had been disastrous.

**[46:22]** But the intention to regulate after the fact

**[46:25]** is to really not slow down or hinder the innovation.

**[46:29]** This is a very different approach from Europe.

**[46:31]** You regulate first and then companies

**[46:33]** have to work around that.

**[46:35]** So this is why Chinese economy is so complex,

**[46:39]** you cannot reduce it to simply a statement

**[46:41]** saying the state is unhelpful for the private

**[46:44]** or something like that.

**[46:47]** There are certain sectors where these SOEs dominate,

**[46:51]** when it comes to national security in terms of energy.

**[46:53]** But let's not focus on these few sectors.

**[46:55]** By and large, most of the economy,

**[46:58]** if you actually admit to the fact


### [47:00 - 48:00]

**[47:00]** that China's highly innovative and highly entrepreneurial

**[47:03]** means that it must be the private sector

**[47:05]** that is driving the show.

**[47:06]** - Innovate first, regulate after, really interesting.

**[47:11]** I also, in my mind,

**[47:13]** am contrasting it with the way the Soviet Union

**[47:16]** and Russia since operated.

**[47:18]** That doesn't sound at all like this model.

**[47:21]** And it's interesting that countries

**[47:23]** that at least on the surface

**[47:25]** had a similar cultural communist problems,

**[47:29]** the bureaucracies that form inside the communist state,

**[47:32]** it just seems that China broke away from that somehow.

**[47:36]** That don't understand exactly what happened.

**[47:39]** - In the West,

**[47:40]** they group these economies together

**[47:42]** as if they're the same thing.

**[47:43]** No, it's not the same at all.

**[47:45]** There's so many differences, so much more flexibility.

**[47:48]** You can have dynamic entrepreneurialism

**[47:51]** at the same time have socialist characteristics.

**[47:53]** And I think this is what China has been able to shape

**[47:56]** and mold,

**[47:57]** a unique model that balances between government industry,


### [48:00 - 49:00]

**[48:01]** between state coordination and market mechanisms,

**[48:05]** and between individualism and communalism.

**[48:07]** It's not necessarily black and white.

**[48:09]** You can have all these things at the same time.

**[48:12]** - So what are the pros and cons

**[48:13]** of being an entrepreneur in China versus the West?

**[48:15]** Like if you get a choice, you have a dream,

**[48:17]** you wanna build epic things,

**[48:20]** and you get to choose where to start that business.

**[48:23]** What are the pros and cons of each path?

**[48:26]** - In China, the speed is just awe inspiring.

**[48:30]** You have a good idea, you implement it,

**[48:32]** you realize you're dream very fast

**[48:33]** because there's also the support system, right?

**[48:35]** The infrastructure there, the digital infrastructure there,

**[48:37]** the engineers are there,

**[48:38]** the talent is there and they're cheap.

**[48:40]** And the market competition is there to keep you going.

**[48:44]** The consumers give you a very, very fast feedback.

**[48:48]** Look at Xiaomi,

**[48:49]** it was making phones and now it makes

**[48:51]** one of the world's best EVs.

**[48:53]** 270,000 cars sold in one day

**[48:56]** a few days ago with the new model.

**[48:58]** They were phone makers.


### [49:00 - 50:00]

**[49:00]** So there's an advantage to that, okay?

**[49:03]** But I would not feel safe,

**[49:07]** not because of danger of expropriation, nothing like that,

**[49:11]** but the bankruptcy laws are not there, right?

**[49:15]** It's not necessarily always fair competition.

**[49:17]** Things don't happen necessarily in orderly manner.

**[49:21]** If you have a competitor,

**[49:22]** you can have a very evil competitor

**[49:24]** and evil competitors are there everywhere in China.

**[49:27]** They would call the police on you, put you in jail,

**[49:30]** spread false rumors about you.

**[49:31]** Maybe that happens also in the US

**[49:33]** but it's a different level in China.

**[49:37]** And also the mold that you can have to protect yourself,

**[49:41]** the IP protection,

**[49:43]** that's much weaker in China

**[49:45]** because the legal system is not very effective.

**[49:47]** You have a good idea, you'll be copied.

**[49:49]** And there's a lot of work.

**[49:51]** You have to dine and wine with the local governments.

**[49:54]** I mean, that's not allowed anymore, by the way.

**[49:56]** But you dine and wine, figuratively speaking,

**[49:59]** you have to have a very good relationship with 'em.


### [50:00 - 51:00]

**[50:01]** That's a different kind of work.

**[50:03]** - The wine and dine and the evil competitors

**[50:06]** is an interesting challenge.

**[50:07]** That in some maybe distant way's akin

**[50:10]** to the problems of the Soviet Union.

**[50:12]** I think, I guess in the United States, there's less of that.

**[50:17]** And I don't even know if that's based on laws,

**[50:20]** because there's a lot of lawyers in the US

**[50:23]** that could do the same kind of evil competitor stuff,

**[50:25]** technically.

**[50:26]** - That's true.

**[50:27]** The potential negative ramifications are there.

**[50:29]** But I think personal protection is a big difference.

**[50:33]** If you make a mistake,

**[50:36]** if your company's not run well you go to jail.

**[50:39]** I think that the US is much, much more

**[50:41]** tolerant on entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs, on failure.

**[50:45]** - Since we're talking about it.

**[50:46]** There was a lot of controversy around Jack Ma disappearing,

**[50:50]** quote unquote, "and reappearing a bit later."

**[50:53]** And there's been sort of rumors of some tense relationships

**[50:57]** that he has with the Chinese government.


### [51:00 - 52:00]

**[51:01]** What is important to understand about the whole situation?

**[51:05]** Like to what degree is it reflective

**[51:07]** of the issues entrepreneurs face in China?

**[51:11]** - In the US, capital controls politics, one could argue.

**[51:16]** In China, it has to be the other way around.

**[51:20]** Capital must be reigned in by politics

**[51:23]** as part of the capitalist class

**[51:25]** do not have the ambition to exceed the powers

**[51:29]** of the political class is really at the core of it, I'd say.

**[51:33]** And the biggest difference between US and China.

**[51:37]** There are important details that I think the West

**[51:42]** has not fully provided to the public, for instance,

**[51:47]** and financial, as innovative as it was,

**[51:53]** was doing banking jobs without being

**[51:57]** regulated like a bank, right?

**[51:59]** So that obviously poses a host


### [52:00 - 53:00]

**[52:02]** of financial stability questions, and rules,

**[52:07]** and regulations and so forth.

**[52:08]** So the fact that IPO was halted,

**[52:10]** you could say that there were strong economic

**[52:14]** regulatory grounds for that.

**[52:16]** But I think more broadly speaking,

**[52:19]** if you're an entrepreneur, part of the capitalist class,

**[52:24]** keep your head down, make money, and that's fine, right?

**[52:28]** Do some philanthropy.

**[52:30]** There are also many, many other billionaires

**[52:33]** that are just fine,

**[52:34]** that are actually very much in favor

**[52:37]** of the political leadership, and they do their thing.

**[52:42]** Now, I'm not saying what's right, what's wrong,

**[52:43]** it's just a very, very different culture

**[52:46]** and different country.

**[52:47]** In the US it's great to be colorful.

**[52:50]** I mean, you have a very, very colorful president.

**[52:53]** He would never have been able to make it in China.

**[52:57]** You have the likes of Elon Musk.

**[52:59]** It's great to be different.


### [53:00 - 54:00]

**[53:00]** It's great to stand out.

**[53:01]** You do not wanna stand out in China.

**[53:05]** So the moral of the story

**[53:07]** is that the top leadership understands

**[53:10]** that it needs these top entrepreneurs, the likes of Jack Ma.

**[53:13]** And they have done so many great things for the country,

**[53:18]** even for the world.

**[53:19]** But in China, garnering too much influence and power,

**[53:25]** even through social media,

**[53:28]** doesn't make you look that great.

**[53:30]** It's not a good thing for you personally.

**[53:32]** And there's a saying in China

**[53:34]** that you just don't wanna be the tallest tree, right?

**[53:37]** The tallest tree gets the most wind.

**[53:40]** So I don't agree at all with the western conclusion

**[53:44]** that this anecdote,

**[53:45]** this story has meant that entrepreneurs

**[53:48]** don't wanna be entrepreneurs anymore,

**[53:49]** where the young kids don't aspire to be people like Jack Ma.

**[53:52]** That's not true at all.

**[53:53]** The incentives are still there.

**[53:55]** It's a different kind of rich elite class in China.

**[53:59]** - So on what dimensions do you think


### [54:00 - 55:00]

**[54:03]** that the height of the tree is measured?

**[54:07]** Is it more about just mouthing off in public?

**[54:12]** So can you still be the richest person in China

**[54:15]** and actually not clash with the state?

**[54:19]** - Absolutely.

**[54:20]** Don't be too outspoken.

**[54:21]** Don't try to get too much attention and too much influence.

**[54:25]** And just again, it's a cultural thing,

**[54:28]** but just keep your head down, be humble,

**[54:31]** contribute to society, do philanthropy,

**[54:34]** collaborate with the government, and you're kind of okay.

**[54:38]** - So the signal the Jack Ma situation sends

**[54:41]** to the entrepreneurs in China is don't be an entrepreneur,

**[54:47]** is more like, don't-

**[54:48]** - [Keyu] Don't be too colorful.

**[54:50]** - Don't be too colorful.

**[54:51]** And colorful means you can be colorful

**[54:53]** about the technical details of your technology,

**[54:57]** but don't be colorful about Xi Jinping, and politics,


### [55:00 - 56:00]

**[55:02]** and just stay out.

**[55:04]** - Yeah, stay out of politics.

**[55:05]** But I just wanna say, that said,

**[55:08]** Jack Ma was really an emblem of extreme success for China.

**[55:16]** And the Chinese entrepreneurs look up to him.

**[55:19]** That's really important.

**[55:20]** It was a signal that unfortunately was misconstrued

**[55:23]** by the side and by also outside world.

**[55:27]** But it's laid a different path

**[55:29]** for what these entrepreneurs should be doing.

**[55:32]** - What do you think happened to him?

**[55:34]** So he's now, I think, living in Japan.

**[55:36]** - That's by choice.

**[55:37]** - By choice.

**[55:38]** - No, look, he's an extremely fascinating character,

**[55:41]** and if he were in the US he'd thrive.

**[55:45]** Funny, witty, smart, wise, creative, loves a good life.

**[55:52]** And I think it's by choice

**[55:53]** that he's roaming around the world,

**[55:56]** given that he has more free time.

**[55:59]** - You think he loves China?


### [56:00 - 57:00]

**[56:00]** - All of them do.

**[56:02]** All of them do because their lives,

**[56:05]** their destinies were totally changed because of China,

**[56:10]** because of the government, because of Deng Xiaoping,

**[56:12]** because of everything.

**[56:14]** - So I know a lot of people from the former Soviet Union

**[56:17]** and there's a deep resentment of broken promises,

**[56:22]** broken dreams.

**[56:23]** So that is not something you see...

**[56:24]** - That's not how I would describe that generation

**[56:27]** and their feelings towards China.

**[56:30]** Of course, you always get exceptions, right?

**[56:31]** The ones who have moved to the US and who wants a democracy.

**[56:35]** But by and large people are deeply grateful to China,

**[56:39]** the Chinese government, the Communist Party,

**[56:41]** if you wanna label it as that,

**[56:43]** because they've seen their lives be totally transformed.

**[56:47]** I mean, Jack Ma went from being a school teacher

**[56:50]** to becoming one of the most powerful people in the world.

**[56:52]** I mean, if you didn't have China,

**[56:55]** how could that have happened, right?

**[56:58]** - Can you speak to the thing you mentioned a few times,


### [57:00 - 58:00]

**[57:00]** which is the difference in American versus Chinese,

**[57:03]** or maybe Western versus Chinese approach

**[57:07]** to entrepreneurship, zero to one versus one to end?

**[57:13]** Maybe can you explain that?

**[57:14]** And what will it take for China to become a consistent

**[57:19]** zero to one innovator for the individual entrepreneurs

**[57:22]** to create totally new things versus doing the things

**[57:25]** you mentioned about speed and scale.

**[57:28]** - The US will lead for some time on breakthroughs,

**[57:32]** on disruptive technologies,

**[57:34]** the zero to one technologies

**[57:36]** that ultimately changed the world.

**[57:39]** But innovation is a process.

**[57:43]** It goes from invention to production and commercialization

**[57:47]** and diffusion,

**[57:48]** diffusing technology throughout all parts of the economy.

**[57:51]** And on those two stages,

**[57:53]** I think that China has a unique advantage,

**[57:54]** even if it still can't do the zero to one breakthroughs.

**[57:58]** Because in the end,

**[57:59]** how much this technology is adopted by the countries


### [58:00 - 59:00]

**[58:04]** and by the various parts of the economy

**[58:06]** is fundamentally crucial

**[58:08]** to how much productivity will be unleashed.

**[58:10]** And China's innovation currently,

**[58:15]** the DeepSeek is really one example.

**[58:16]** And I think it's really the beginning of the scale-based,

**[58:20]** leading edge technology,

**[58:22]** cost-cutting driven kind of innovation model

**[58:25]** could be just as powerful,

**[58:28]** maybe even more effective

**[58:29]** and powerful than the breakthroughs.

**[58:33]** And as a very different approach to innovation,

**[58:36]** the Chinese companies focus on solutions, problem solving.

**[58:41]** Again, that comes back to the education system, right?

**[58:43]** You're giving a problem, I'm gonna find the answer,

**[58:45]** the Chinese students can do it.

**[58:47]** You want them to write their own question,

**[58:50]** they can't do it, right?

**[58:51]** I'm exaggerating a little bit,

**[58:52]** but it's a little like that, right?

**[58:53]** They see a problem they're gonna go after

**[58:55]** and they're gonna find the best solution.

**[58:57]** And that's really, really useful, right?

**[58:59]** Because we don't need,


### [59:00 - 01:00:00]

**[59:01]** or developing countries especially,

**[59:03]** don't need these frontier technologies that they can't use.

**[59:06]** And China currently has this AI Plus program,

**[59:10]** which is about pushing AI into every single plausible sector

**[59:14]** with the help of the state.

**[59:16]** So adoption diffusion is very important.

**[59:20]** Why China can't do breakthroughs

**[59:24]** or can't do zero to one technologies,

**[59:26]** I think at the root of it, and there are some deeper,

**[59:31]** we talked about the proximate reasons,

**[59:35]** the short, flat, fast, for instance, right?

**[59:37]** You don't wanna spend too much time on investigating

**[59:40]** something that you don't even know

**[59:42]** if it's commercially viable.

**[59:43]** So basic research is still weaker

**[59:46]** than in the US universities,

**[59:48]** but also this kind of intrinsic motivation.

**[59:50]** It's very different, right?

**[59:52]** In China, it's driven by extrinsic motivation.

**[59:54]** You are rewarded by compensation,

**[59:58]** financial compensation,

**[59:59]** all these kind of extrinsic motivation is what drives you.


### [01:00:00 - 01:01:00]

**[01:00:02]** But intrinsic motivation,

**[01:00:04]** pursuit of knowledge for knowledge sake,

**[01:00:07]** that was deep in the Confucius philosophies.

**[01:00:09]** But of course poverty has changed all that.

**[01:00:11]** The profound commitment to scholarship, to research,

**[01:00:16]** which we know is very much true in the US universities,

**[01:00:21]** it's starting, it's starting, but it's not there.

**[01:00:24]** So I think these two approaches

**[01:00:26]** are actually quite compatible with each other.

**[01:00:28]** I don't know what all this fuss is about, right?

**[01:00:31]** China uses technology very well.

**[01:00:33]** It can scale up and reduce costs,

**[01:00:36]** and then it can spread it around.

**[01:00:38]** And the US makes the highest value added

**[01:00:41]** by inventing these technologies.

**[01:00:44]** But again, diffusion matters.

**[01:00:47]** - Well, yeah, the things you mentioned, the scale,

**[01:00:50]** the manufacturing, the diffusion,

**[01:00:53]** from a sort of economics perspective,

**[01:00:55]** you wonder which is the more important skill to have.

**[01:00:58]** And it seems like the cost-cutting,


### [01:01:00 - 01:02:00]

**[01:01:03]** the efficient, large scale fast manufacturer,

**[01:01:06]** the diffusion is much more important

**[01:01:08]** for the success and the growth of the economy.

**[01:01:11]** - I think where it ultimately leads an impact

**[01:01:13]** on the economy, that's more important.

**[01:01:17]** It's this persistent question we have,

**[01:01:20]** why don't we see the productivity in the numbers, right?

**[01:01:24]** You're in AI.

**[01:01:25]** AI, we had long periods of investment, right?

**[01:01:28]** You hadn't seen it in the numbers until maybe even recently,

**[01:01:32]** and it's still very slow.

**[01:01:33]** But China's pushing that in the sectors;

**[01:01:36]** robotics, AI, cloud, industrial, internet of things.

**[01:01:41]** And even companies like Huawei,

**[01:01:42]** I think it's gotten a little bit of too bad of a rep

**[01:01:47]** in the US,

**[01:01:48]** but American engineers working for Huawei

**[01:01:50]** said that they're so happy working for Huawei.

**[01:01:53]** The intent focus on innovation,

**[01:01:55]** but also on solution-driven innovations in Africa,

**[01:01:59]** in rural areas, really changes people's lives.


### [01:02:00 - 01:03:00]

**[01:02:01]** It doesn't change the world,

**[01:02:02]** but it changes individuals' lives.

**[01:02:04]** - What's the feeling that Chinese entrepreneurs

**[01:02:08]** have about copying technology?

**[01:02:11]** Because I think one of the cultural things in the US

**[01:02:14]** is just really not respected if you copy.

**[01:02:18]** That's seen as a big problem.

**[01:02:21]** And is there some degree to where in China it's not?

**[01:02:24]** - No, unfortunately this is a big cultural difference.

**[01:02:29]** Our sense of property rights

**[01:02:32]** is actually quite different from the US.

**[01:02:34]** I think that will change over time.

**[01:02:36]** But absolutely, you're right.

**[01:02:39]** They have no qualms about copying

**[01:02:41]** as long as it leads to success, right?

**[01:02:43]** That's the difference in values.

**[01:02:45]** As we mentioned in the beginning,

**[01:02:47]** you asked why the level of competition is so fierce.

**[01:02:50]** Well, they all do the same thing.

**[01:02:52]** Once they've seen one successful thing,

**[01:02:54]** everybody does the same thing.

**[01:02:56]** You'd have no respect for doing that in the US, right?

**[01:02:59]** But in China, it's all fine.


### [01:03:00 - 01:04:00]

**[01:03:00]** But I think that over time it will change.

**[01:03:03]** Just give it a little bit of time.

**[01:03:04]** - So to you fundamentally, it's a bad thing.

**[01:03:07]** - In the end,

**[01:03:08]** if China's all about innovation technology,

**[01:03:11]** you cannot not have very strict IP protection.

**[01:03:15]** - [Lex] True.

**[01:03:16]** - And ultimately, again,

**[01:03:18]** we're still in the short, flat, fast stage, right?

**[01:03:22]** When we graduate from that stage,

**[01:03:25]** you're gonna have very different views about these things

**[01:03:27]** and try to diversify and do different things.

**[01:03:29]** But again, it's a stage.

**[01:03:31]** Chinese people were hungry,

**[01:03:32]** they're still a little bit hungry.

**[01:03:33]** They're not gonna be as hungry in the future.

**[01:03:35]** - So can you describe the DeepSeek moment

**[01:03:38]** and DeepSeek as it represents

**[01:03:39]** what China's thinking about in the space of AI?

**[01:03:41]** And does China have a chance

**[01:03:45]** at outrunning us in the AI race?

**[01:03:50]** - DeepSeek was a surprise to the world,

**[01:03:52]** but I don't think it was that much of a surprise

**[01:03:55]** to the same degree to the Chinese.

**[01:03:59]** And remember that DeepSeek happened in times of crisis,


### [01:04:00 - 01:05:00]

**[01:04:05]** urgency, not in times of comfort.

**[01:04:08]** A lot of these technological breakthroughs

**[01:04:11]** and leapfrogging happens in times of crisis.

**[01:04:15]** This is called crisis innovation.

**[01:04:17]** And you gotta thank the US for that, right?

**[01:04:20]** When the Chinese were comfortably

**[01:04:22]** importing chips from the US,

**[01:04:24]** the whole industry stalled for 20 years.

**[01:04:27]** I mean, why would you plow in billions,

**[01:04:28]** tens of billions and even more

**[01:04:30]** when you can just import the best, right?

**[01:04:32]** You don't wanna do your own in innovation.

**[01:04:34]** It's because of these export controls,

**[01:04:37]** these sanctions on these companies

**[01:04:38]** that Chinese companies in the Chinese state

**[01:04:41]** felt an existential crisis a few years ago

**[01:04:46]** by being cut off from these critical components.

**[01:04:49]** And guess what happened?

**[01:04:50]** In a short amount of time,

**[01:04:51]** a degree of domestic capacity ramping up and catch up

**[01:04:56]** has been nothing short of remarkable.

**[01:04:58]** Again, thanks to US truculence on technology.


### [01:05:00 - 01:06:00]

**[01:05:03]** Now, I'm sure there are many aspects

**[01:05:06]** of hyperbole related to DeepSeek,

**[01:05:09]** but it just shows you that the gap is much smaller

**[01:05:13]** between the China and the US on leading edge technologies

**[01:05:16]** than what was expected

**[01:05:17]** that these export controls were not effective.

**[01:05:19]** They may have even backfired.

**[01:05:21]** And it shows you that China has this relentless focus

**[01:05:26]** on taking some of the existing technologies

**[01:05:30]** and using scale and the advantages

**[01:05:36]** to cut cost and to diffuse.

**[01:05:39]** And this is just the beginning.

**[01:05:41]** I think it will happen in many other industries as well,

**[01:05:43]** including in semiconductors.

**[01:05:46]** And that's a Chinese approach.

**[01:05:48]** Now, there's an interesting dilemma here,

**[01:05:52]** which is that this is happening in a time

**[01:05:56]** of extreme economic softness, slow down,


### [01:06:00 - 01:07:00]

**[01:06:01]** and missed uncertainty, trade wars, a lack of confidence,

**[01:06:08]** a slow down in private investment and consumption,

**[01:06:11]** a withdrawal of foreign investment from China,

**[01:06:14]** especially the US venture funding.

**[01:06:19]** Imagine what China had would've been like, let's say,

**[01:06:22]** if the economy was doing better, right?

**[01:06:25]** But you could also argue that it's because

**[01:06:27]** people feel threatened that they make more leaves.

**[01:06:29]** Now, I wish the world we don't have to drive each other

**[01:06:33]** to the corners to do something great.

**[01:06:36]** But that is the reality.

**[01:06:37]** And I don't think that there's an easy say between who wins,

**[01:06:42]** because I think the winning idea

**[01:06:44]** is part of the old playbook, right?

**[01:06:46]** You're all kind of part of a network.

**[01:06:48]** Different countries,

**[01:06:49]** different players have different choke points on each other.

**[01:06:52]** I don't think it's just about the US and China.

**[01:06:54]** And what's more, you use your leverage once,

**[01:06:59]** and that leverage has a half-life.


### [01:07:00 - 01:08:00]

**[01:07:02]** It becomes a lot less effective the second time around

**[01:07:05]** because other countries,

**[01:07:06]** other companies are gonna try to substitute it away.

**[01:07:08]** If China uses the rare earth leverage,

**[01:07:11]** which I think it is now a little bit,

**[01:07:15]** there will be alternatives and substitutes.

**[01:07:18]** Gotta be very, very careful

**[01:07:19]** of what coercion leverage means.

**[01:07:21]** Same thing with the US, right?

**[01:07:24]** So I think this is all the old thinking

**[01:07:26]** of who wins, who dominates.

**[01:07:27]** I think we need a new playbook.

**[01:07:29]** - So to you maybe when you refer to Biden and Trump,

**[01:07:33]** if you go back to Biden, it would be the CHIPS Act.

**[01:07:35]** So the export controls created unintended,

**[01:07:39]** unexpected effect where it had the reverse...

**[01:07:44]** - I hope it was unintentional,

**[01:07:44]** otherwise you'd be questioning the level of intelligence

**[01:07:48]** of the US administration, right?

**[01:07:50]** But I think that the things they laid out did the opposite

**[01:07:55]** of what was intended.

**[01:07:57]** It sped up domestic capacity.


### [01:08:00 - 01:09:00]

**[01:08:01]** It motivated the whole country

**[01:08:05]** to do this whole of a nation program to go after technology,

**[01:08:07]** is kind of like the way they go after Olympics, right?

**[01:08:10]** Olympic gold medals.

**[01:08:11]** They wanted to maximize Olympic gold medals,

**[01:08:13]** and they put the whole nation at work and all the resources.

**[01:08:15]** And that's what China did.

**[01:08:17]** Huawei, another example, they were sanctioned.

**[01:08:19]** Guess what?

**[01:08:21]** They have come back to life stronger than ever before.

**[01:08:24]** And this is not unique to this episode.

**[01:08:27]** If we look at throughout history,

**[01:08:29]** lease blockades don't work.

**[01:08:30]** The continental system actually indirectly

**[01:08:34]** led to industrial revolution in the UK

**[01:08:38]** when the Spanish kind of blockade the Portuguese,

**[01:08:44]** they came up with a very ferocious, forceful naval power.

**[01:08:48]** And you're talking about China here,

**[01:08:50]** they just don't lie down and lie flat and say,

**[01:08:53]** Ooh, we give up."

**[01:08:55]** They're more motivated than ever before.

**[01:08:59]** - So the lesson is don't force people or nations


### [01:09:00 - 01:10:00]

**[01:09:05]** into a corner.

**[01:09:06]** - Yeah.

**[01:09:07]** You make them have a very comfortable situation

**[01:09:10]** and they tend to become complacent.

**[01:09:14]** And they stagnate.

**[01:09:16]** - All right, so can you talk through the whole saga

**[01:09:20]** of the Trump's tariffs is still going on,

**[01:09:23]** especially tariffs on China.

**[01:09:25]** From your perspective as an economist,

**[01:09:27]** to what degree was it justified?

**[01:09:29]** To what degree was it effective?

**[01:09:30]** To what degree is it bad policy for US, for the West,

**[01:09:35]** for the world, also for China?

**[01:09:39]** - China has been preparing for this for the last five years,

**[01:09:42]** and for the return of Trump,

**[01:09:44]** (both laughing)

**[01:09:46]** and for Trump's maniac trade policies.

**[01:09:50]** You'd think that Trump also had five years to prepare

**[01:09:53]** for this battle with China.

**[01:09:55]** It didn't show.

**[01:09:58]** You can say that the Chinese, at least this time around,


### [01:10:00 - 01:11:00]

**[01:10:02]** have played their hand pretty well

**[01:10:04]** when dealing with Trump's tariff threats and the trade war,

**[01:10:09]** with a level of calibrated assertiveness.

**[01:10:12]** They have really thought through

**[01:10:14]** everything very elaborately.

**[01:10:15]** And look, this is not good for either country.

**[01:10:19]** Let's just be clear.

**[01:10:20]** It's bad for US and China, and it's bad for the world.

**[01:10:25]** And every country has a stake in the US-China trade war

**[01:10:30]** because whether you trade directly

**[01:10:32]** or indirectly with China, you're gonna be affected.

**[01:10:35]** They are one of the largest intermediate exporters

**[01:10:38]** in the world.

**[01:10:39]** And Chinese manufacturing goods

**[01:10:42]** anchor global manufacturing prices.

**[01:10:47]** The cumulative tariff burdens,

**[01:10:50]** when you get to Canada, when you get to Mexico,

**[01:10:51]** when you get to any other final destination,

**[01:10:54]** these tariffs will affect you, right?

**[01:10:58]** So it's clearly very, very bad for the world.


### [01:11:00 - 01:12:00]

**[01:11:03]** China's core principles,

**[01:11:05]** and I think that this is not well understood

**[01:11:08]** from the rest of the world towards the US

**[01:11:11]** and something that they have kept up is equivalence,

**[01:11:15]** reciprocity, and realism.

**[01:11:18]** China's not gonna lower tariffs unless the US does, right?

**[01:11:20]** You can kind of stand up to Trump like a man.

**[01:11:23]** That's the only way to deal with Trump.

**[01:11:25]** That's its view.

**[01:11:28]** The deal has to be realistic.

**[01:11:30]** The phase one deal of the last time wasn't realistic.

**[01:11:32]** And China thinks,

**[01:11:33]** look, the US is gonna use this as a leverage, right?

**[01:11:37]** That's not possible.

**[01:11:39]** This can't be seen as political concession.

**[01:11:43]** The deal has to be seen as mutual commerce.

**[01:11:46]** So where China can have room to negotiate

**[01:11:50]** is opening up things like services.

**[01:11:52]** American banks,

**[01:11:53]** American financial institutions

**[01:11:54]** have a lot of business to do in China.

**[01:11:56]** They can buy a limited number of more goods.

**[01:11:59]** They can discuss about transparency around rules


### [01:12:00 - 01:13:00]

**[01:12:03]** and regulations on e-commerce, on data.

**[01:12:05]** All of that is fine.

**[01:12:06]** But don't confound economic issues with political issues.

**[01:12:11]** Hong Kong, Taiwan is not part of the deal, by the way,

**[01:12:14]** in case anyone was wondering,

**[01:12:16]** trying to change China's state

**[01:12:19]** hybrid private sector model, don't go there.

**[01:12:23]** Anything that challenges China's technology, security,

**[01:12:27]** that's not really part of the discussion.

**[01:12:29]** I think that people have to be clear

**[01:12:32]** about also what China thinks and wants,

**[01:12:35]** and also the Chinese to be clear about what Trump wants.

**[01:12:37]** Although I don't know anybody,

**[01:12:39]** even Trump himself knows exactly what he wants in order

**[01:12:42]** for these very complex negotiations to actually succeed.

**[01:12:47]** - Okay, so China has a few red lines,

**[01:12:51]** so don't mention Hong Kong or Taiwan.

**[01:12:54]** - Don't mix the political issues with the trade deal.

**[01:12:58]** - And then is there some degree maybe you can speak


### [01:13:00 - 01:14:00]

**[01:13:00]** to culturally where stylistically there's red lines,

**[01:13:06]** meaning don't bully China like language wise,

**[01:13:11]** or does that not matter?

**[01:13:13]** Because there's a kind of way of speaking

**[01:13:15]** in the United States that I feel like in diplomacy

**[01:13:21]** in general,

**[01:13:23]** neither side wants to be humiliated.

**[01:13:25]** And in great deals, even when one side on paper wins,

**[01:13:32]** you wanna make the other side,

**[01:13:34]** especially the side that gets the short end of the stake,

**[01:13:37]** feel like they've won and show the rest of the world

**[01:13:40]** that they're the winner.

**[01:13:42]** - Well, that's diplomacy.

**[01:13:43]** - That's diplomacy.

**[01:13:44]** - We have an absence of diplomacy.

**[01:13:45]** But you're absolutely right, there needs to be respect.

**[01:13:48]** The Chinese at least really care about respect.

**[01:13:53]** And I wish there was a just a bit more cultural fluency.

**[01:13:57]** And I think a lot of things would be so much easier

**[01:13:59]** between the two countries, just understanding that,


### [01:14:00 - 01:15:00]

**[01:14:03]** because you can actually push China

**[01:14:04]** to do a lot of things all within reason

**[01:14:07]** that would work in favor of the US.

**[01:14:10]** But understand respect is vitally important.

**[01:14:13]** Face saving is very, very, very important.

**[01:14:16]** - To what degree what Xi Jinping says

**[01:14:19]** and what they're putting out there in the world

**[01:14:22]** represents the truth?

**[01:14:24]** So he has a whole way of being of like, let's deescalate,

**[01:14:28]** let's all make good deals together,

**[01:14:33]** like Modi a little bit has a similar way of being like,

**[01:14:36]** "Let's just..."

**[01:14:37]** And the implied thing is like, forgive the French,

**[01:14:41]** but if you fuck with us won't be nice,

**[01:14:44]** but let's just all be nice together.

**[01:14:46]** Is he speaking the truth?

**[01:14:48]** - Xi Jinping is not Putin, right?

**[01:14:51]** And there is a genuine desire on China's part to deescalate,

**[01:14:57]** again, coming back to the level of pragmatism.


### [01:15:00 - 01:16:00]

**[01:15:01]** Under economic strain, in China,

**[01:15:03]** you don't really wanna be picking fights.

**[01:15:07]** They don't agree at all with Trump's economic views

**[01:15:13]** and world vision, let's just put it simply.

**[01:15:16]** So understanding that a lot of this is also driven

**[01:15:22]** by American internal politics,

**[01:15:24]** which they are aware of helps a bit,

**[01:15:27]** but there's a genuine desire to take the temperature down

**[01:15:30]** with the US even if the weather

**[01:15:32]** doesn't fundamentally change.

**[01:15:34]** - What does a good diplomacy look like here for both sides?

**[01:15:39]** What is the best possible,

**[01:15:41]** just strictly on the economics on the trade, the tariffs,

**[01:15:45]** what's the best possible outcome for the world?

**[01:15:49]** - I think that Trump can show to the American consumers

**[01:15:52]** that he has gotten some sort of a deal, right?

**[01:15:54]** That the Chinese have bought more American goods

**[01:15:57]** or promised to buy American goods.

**[01:15:58]** And then that American companies can come into China.


### [01:16:00 - 01:17:00]

**[01:16:01]** And then a lot of the previously restricted

**[01:16:04]** investment opportunities are now non-restricted.

**[01:16:06]** And the American banks can make money in China.

**[01:16:09]** He can say that.

**[01:16:11]** And I think that could be part of a really realistic deal

**[01:16:17]** that somehow American companies will be better protected

**[01:16:20]** through IP protection.

**[01:16:21]** And again, that's in China's interest as well.

**[01:16:24]** So I don't see a fundamental conflict here.

**[01:16:26]** And at the same time, they lower the tariffs, right?

**[01:16:29]** Not to the rates where they were before,

**[01:16:31]** but lower and you don't prohibit trade.

**[01:16:35]** And then for China, that would also be success.

**[01:16:38]** So you can actually have success for both places.

**[01:16:40]** But being realistic is part of the game.

**[01:16:43]** - Is tariffs...

**[01:16:45]** Question to you as an economist,

**[01:16:46]** is tariffs a useful effective tool for global trade?

**[01:16:55]** - No.

**[01:16:56]** I think that there is a real problem


### [01:17:00 - 01:18:00]

**[01:17:00]** in global trading system and globalization in general

**[01:17:04]** that is not gonna be resolved by tariffs.

**[01:17:07]** We do need to think about more harmony between countries

**[01:17:15]** where let's say not one country dominates.

**[01:17:17]** And here I'd push back on China and say,

**[01:17:21]** yes, you have amazing companies and competitive companies,

**[01:17:24]** but you just can't dominate everything,

**[01:17:26]** that would not be good for global harmony.

**[01:17:28]** You need to give other countries an opportunity.

**[01:17:32]** You need to develop your own internal economy, right?

**[01:17:34]** Rely on your consumers as part of the deal.

**[01:17:37]** Tariffs, this kind of highly protectionist method

**[01:17:41]** is very distortionary and it's gonna be bad for the US.

**[01:17:44]** I'd actually argue that both China and the US

**[01:17:48]** have totally taken advantage

**[01:17:51]** and also enjoyed the global economic realm

**[01:17:57]** under the US liberal order.


### [01:18:00 - 01:19:00]

**[01:18:00]** I think that China quite likes it actually.

**[01:18:03]** US kept a peace.

**[01:18:05]** And during this peaceful times,

**[01:18:06]** things were working very well economically, technologically,

**[01:18:10]** they kept the sea lanes open,

**[01:18:13]** they did their part to preserve peace

**[01:18:16]** to the extent they can, I guess.

**[01:18:18]** But China wants peace, right?

**[01:18:20]** Only with peace can they do what they can.

**[01:18:22]** And actually US, despite saying they've been victimized,

**[01:18:25]** no, look, they've had a very, very good time, right?

**[01:18:28]** Never have quality of life, standards of living,

**[01:18:31]** technology risen as much as the US did

**[01:18:34]** under its own liberal order than it has ever before.

**[01:18:37]** And the amount of influence and power,

**[01:18:39]** yes, of course you can blame the US

**[01:18:42]** for lots of things that happened,

**[01:18:43]** but it actually had a really good time and China as well.

**[01:18:47]** So now they're gonna take this apart.

**[01:18:49]** They think that they're gonna be somehow better off

**[01:18:52]** that American people and Chinese people

**[01:18:54]** are gonna be better off under more disorderly, fragmented,

**[01:18:57]** rule of a jungle kind of world?


### [01:19:00 - 01:20:00]

**[01:19:00]** That's an illusion.

**[01:19:01]** That's what politicians tell their people.

**[01:19:03]** But that's not the truth.

**[01:19:05]** - So what are, if not tariffs,

**[01:19:08]** ways to incentivize countries like the United States

**[01:19:12]** to build internally?

**[01:19:13]** So to build semiconductor ships internally, for example?

**[01:19:17]** - Well, exactly.

**[01:19:18]** Tariffs is a way to punish foreigners.

**[01:19:20]** But what you really wanna do

**[01:19:22]** is to strengthen your own domestic competitiveness.

**[01:19:24]** And I wanna draw an analogy to the US-Japan competition

**[01:19:30]** in the 1980s.

**[01:19:32]** Japan actually took over in many parts

**[01:19:34]** of the semiconductors industry,

**[01:19:36]** even though the microchip was invented in the US.

**[01:19:38]** But guess what happened?

**[01:19:39]** Well, it actually drove more competition

**[01:19:43]** and more mobilization in the US actually

**[01:19:45]** creating this innovation system,

**[01:19:47]** changed a few really critical laws

**[01:19:49]** that helped with US innovation.

**[01:19:51]** And the consumers benefited.

**[01:19:53]** The US took over again

**[01:19:55]** as the leader of the semiconductors industry.

**[01:19:57]** There's no better way than to strengthen yourself


### [01:20:00 - 01:21:00]

**[01:20:00]** to be competitive because ultimately tariffs

**[01:20:05]** have not done anything to help the US,

**[01:20:07]** the trade deficits have have widened since Trump, right?

**[01:20:12]** They haven't closed the imbalance with China,

**[01:20:15]** with the rest of the world

**[01:20:17]** because ultimately the US saves less than in a mess.

**[01:20:22]** And that's a macro phenomenon.

**[01:20:24]** It's not a trade phenomenon.

**[01:20:25]** But I fear that the US by kind of dropping off

**[01:20:29]** of this global trading network and system,

**[01:20:34]** it will lose more and more of its power.

**[01:20:37]** You have power when you're deeply engaged

**[01:20:40]** and embedded with a country.

**[01:20:42]** Once you've left it, you actually lose any sort of leverage.

**[01:20:47]** - So there's gotta be ways to incentivize industrial policy,

**[01:20:50]** building more stuff in internally without terrorists, right?

**[01:20:54]** To just invest from a federal perspective,

**[01:20:56]** you've invest in companies maybe like carrot


### [01:21:00 - 01:22:00]

**[01:21:02]** towards the domestic versus stick versus the foreigner.

**[01:21:05]** - All kinds of subsidies that are justified

**[01:21:08]** for the green transition for innovation R&D,

**[01:21:13]** support for the university system,

**[01:21:15]** the US is the world leader in terms

**[01:21:18]** of attracting talent as everything going for it.

**[01:21:21]** But it was a little bit complacent.

**[01:21:24]** And by dropping off of that global network,

**[01:21:27]** it's gonna do itself more disservice.

**[01:21:29]** - Yeah, tariffs don't quite make sense to me,

**[01:21:32]** but maybe I'm dumb.

**[01:21:33]** It just doesn't make.

**[01:21:34]** - It doesn't make sense to economists either.

**[01:21:35]** And economists are not all dumb.

**[01:21:38]** (both laughing)

**[01:21:40]** - All right.

**[01:21:42]** You did mention immigration a little bit,

**[01:21:43]** so I think that's a component of it also.

**[01:21:47]** You said your own experience was that US was much more open

**[01:21:51]** to immigration in the past.

**[01:21:54]** What do you think about this on the human side,

**[01:21:57]** the protectionism,

**[01:21:59]** the closing of the borders that the US is doing?


### [01:22:00 - 01:23:00]

**[01:22:03]** What are the pros and cons of that

**[01:22:05]** from an economics perspective?

**[01:22:07]** - On US immigration, you see,

**[01:22:10]** I understand both sides of the story to be very honest.

**[01:22:14]** And I also understand a bit of the protectionist streak,

**[01:22:16]** not only coming from the US but also from Europe

**[01:22:19]** and various parts of the world, which is gonna be a trend.

**[01:22:22]** I understand that before you care about people

**[01:22:25]** in the rural villages in Indonesia,

**[01:22:27]** you really care about the northern Brits in this country

**[01:22:31]** and they have not fared well.

**[01:22:33]** I understand that your jobs may be under threat

**[01:22:38]** because of this uncontrolled influx of illegal immigrants.

**[01:22:46]** From a purely economic and rational level,

**[01:22:49]** you'd say immigration is very important

**[01:22:51]** because it keeps the prices down, keeps inflation down,

**[01:22:55]** it keeps up the supply,

**[01:22:57]** which is very important when you have that much demand.


### [01:23:00 - 01:24:00]

**[01:23:00]** And look, the standards of living have also improved

**[01:23:04]** for many people who can afford it, right?

**[01:23:06]** The low cost workers being able

**[01:23:09]** to sustain the service economy.

**[01:23:12]** So I understand both sides of the story.

**[01:23:14]** I think that in the end, it is a balance.

**[01:23:18]** And I do believe even as an economist, that social harmony,

**[01:23:21]** and I come back to this word harmony repeatedly,

**[01:23:23]** even though as an economist this thing doesn't even exist,

**[01:23:28]** is becoming ever more important.

**[01:23:32]** And as a nation some kinds of skilled immigration

**[01:23:38]** is actually what makes the US

**[01:23:39]** the most technologically advanced country in the world.

**[01:23:45]** At the same time,

**[01:23:45]** you do have to think about your own citizens,

**[01:23:47]** the ones that have had generations and been around

**[01:23:50]** and you have to think about their livelihoods.

**[01:23:52]** - Yeah, the puzzle of social harmony is a fascinating one.

**[01:23:54]** 'Cause you spoke to the long history of China, how they...

**[01:23:57]** - Yeah, that was Confucius.

**[01:23:59]** - Yeah, that's Confucius.


### [01:24:00 - 01:25:00]

**[01:24:00]** And then there is a kind of social harmony,

**[01:24:03]** a very different set of ideologies in the United States

**[01:24:06]** and in the West broadly.

**[01:24:08]** And it's all a puzzle and you do want to have some cohesion.

**[01:24:12]** But in the United States,

**[01:24:14]** one of its beautiful aspects is the diversity of humans.

**[01:24:19]** And so the continued influx of diversity

**[01:24:26]** feeds the machine that makes America great also,

**[01:24:30]** but too much breaks the fabric of that society.

**[01:24:35]** So it such an interesting puzzle.

**[01:24:37]** And some of it is like we humans can't balance.

**[01:24:40]** So you go one extreme the other,

**[01:24:42]** and you just oscillate back and forth.

**[01:24:44]** And then also politics, especially in the United States,

**[01:24:48]** there's a red team, and a blue team,

**[01:24:50]** and when the red team is at the top,

**[01:24:55]** the blue team just pulls all the way

**[01:24:56]** to the other direction and vice versa.

**[01:24:58]** And we just kind of oscillate back and forth in this way


### [01:25:00 - 01:26:00]

**[01:25:01]** and hopefully make progress over time.

**[01:25:03]** - But I wanna come back to the point of choice, right?

**[01:25:06]** What makes America so great

**[01:25:09]** is that it tolerates instability, it tolerates clashes,

**[01:25:15]** it tolerates volatility.

**[01:25:17]** Think about the financial crisis, right?

**[01:25:19]** The financial volatility of, again,

**[01:25:21]** the US dollar is where it is because of this deep

**[01:25:24]** liquid financial system in the US

**[01:25:27]** that no other country has managed to build.

**[01:25:30]** There are clashes everywhere in society,

**[01:25:35]** but it is a very diverse country

**[01:25:37]** with all the benefits to that.

**[01:25:39]** It is a highly, highly unequal country,

**[01:25:43]** economically speaking.

**[01:25:46]** The CEO pays, right?

**[01:25:49]** The businessmen being able to be in top political positions,

**[01:25:52]** you kind of balk at that level of cronyism, if you will.

**[01:25:59]** But the US is the leadership


### [01:26:00 - 01:27:00]

**[01:26:04]** and it kinda is able to stomach that volatility

**[01:26:08]** and clash without breaking apart.

**[01:26:11]** And other countries don't have the capacity

**[01:26:13]** of the institutions,

**[01:26:15]** the culture to be able to tolerate and still maintain

**[01:26:20]** to keep the society together.

**[01:26:22]** So I think it is a very interesting,

**[01:26:25]** but yeah, it's a puzzle.

**[01:26:29]** - So we talked about the economic side of tariffs

**[01:26:32]** and you mentioned the other red line and the three Ts.

**[01:26:36]** Can we talk about Taiwan?

**[01:26:39]** So how important is Taiwan to the Chinese economy

**[01:26:42]** and the global economy?

**[01:26:44]** - Taiwan has, among other things, TSMC,

**[01:26:47]** which is vitally important for the global economy.

**[01:26:50]** It's also very important

**[01:26:52]** for the Chinese leadership and the Chinese people.

**[01:26:56]** You don't wanna ask what I think,

**[01:26:58]** ask the Chinese young generation.


### [01:27:00 - 01:28:00]

**[01:27:01]** They would one day like to see unification.

**[01:27:04]** It's part of the patriotic, the dream, if you will.

**[01:27:11]** It's a chip right between the US and China.

**[01:27:15]** So everybody is watching Taiwan,

**[01:27:17]** but I'd say that this attention is not necessarily good

**[01:27:20]** for Taiwan because all this uncertainty

**[01:27:23]** on the political risk has meant that investment there

**[01:27:25]** has dramatically been curtailed.

**[01:27:28]** And mainland China

**[01:27:31]** is a very, very important economic partner

**[01:27:33]** to the Taiwanese economy.

**[01:27:36]** I think that I don't have a lot of views around this,

**[01:27:41]** but I just say this,

**[01:27:43]** I think there's more political wisdom

**[01:27:46]** of the Chinese government side

**[01:27:48]** than we assume outside of China.

**[01:27:52]** And that strategic ambiguity,

**[01:27:54]** but also strategic patience,

**[01:27:56]** especially given China's economic situation currently


### [01:28:00 - 01:29:00]

**[01:28:01]** means that more likely or not,

**[01:28:03]** I think that if China does really well economically

**[01:28:09]** and Taiwan is not doing as well economically as we've seen,

**[01:28:12]** that over time,

**[01:28:14]** this is still the best strategy from China's point of view

**[01:28:19]** to resolve these differences.

**[01:28:21]** I think any military use and action

**[01:28:25]** would be actually quite detrimental to China.

**[01:28:31]** - So what's a way to avoid military conflict here?

**[01:28:34]** It seems like a red line,

**[01:28:36]** unification is the red line for the United States

**[01:28:41]** and it just feels like a very tense situation.

**[01:28:45]** So is there a path forward here

**[01:28:47]** that avoids any military conflict

**[01:28:50]** where everybody's happy from an economics perspective,

**[01:28:54]** from a semiconductor manufacturer perspective also?

**[01:28:58]** - Well, first of all,

**[01:28:58]** you have to keep the communication channel open, right?


### [01:29:00 - 01:30:00]

**[01:29:01]** There was a risk of that being shut off

**[01:29:03]** during the Biden administration.

**[01:29:05]** That's highly, highly dangerous.

**[01:29:06]** - You meaning US-China communication?

**[01:29:08]** - Yeah.

**[01:29:09]** There's also something that I think people miss,

**[01:29:12]** which is that the soldiers in mainland China,

**[01:29:16]** that's part of the one child policy generation, right?

**[01:29:20]** There's only one son.

**[01:29:22]** Families have only one son.

**[01:29:24]** And I think to assume that the Chinese people desire

**[01:29:29]** and would be able to forsake that generation

**[01:29:33]** for unification purposes

**[01:29:35]** or be able to tolerate lost lives for this,

**[01:29:40]** I think is also a bit of an exaggeration and stretch.

**[01:29:43]** And I think Chinese people also

**[01:29:49]** they really care about peace and stability.

**[01:29:53]** Chaos is just not part of what they think is good for them.

**[01:29:58]** The role that TSMC plays is so critical


### [01:30:00 - 01:31:00]

**[01:30:02]** given the choke point they have on the rest of the world

**[01:30:06]** in the semiconductors industry,

**[01:30:07]** which we know is one of the most important industries,

**[01:30:10]** sustaining the economy,

**[01:30:12]** not to mention things like AI and technologies.

**[01:30:17]** Look, the US has been trying to build

**[01:30:22]** another TSMC outside of Taiwan.

**[01:30:26]** It's very, very, very slow, right?

**[01:30:30]** There are a lot of cumulative knowledge, experience,

**[01:30:35]** and skills that are involved.

**[01:30:37]** It's not that easy.

**[01:30:39]** The Chinese don't wanna see an eruption of TSMC either,

**[01:30:44]** because again, it's vitally important for everybody.

**[01:30:49]** Whilst I don't think

**[01:30:50]** that this is really necessarily a bargaining chip,

**[01:30:53]** because if you really see

**[01:30:56]** what the Chinese thinks about Taiwan,

**[01:30:58]** it goes beyond economics.


### [01:31:00 - 01:32:00]

**[01:31:00]** It goes beyond the logical.

**[01:31:01]** It is about realizing a dream,

**[01:31:06]** which even I tended to not place enough importance,

**[01:31:14]** but when I talk to the young people in China,

**[01:31:16]** I realized that it's still their dream.

**[01:31:19]** - It's just unfortunate that this dream is mixed up

**[01:31:22]** in the fact that Taiwan with TSMC

**[01:31:24]** has been incredibly good at manufacturing.

**[01:31:26]** It's just like a interesting puzzle of why it's so difficult

**[01:31:30]** at low cost at scale to manufacture chips.

**[01:31:33]** And it's just incredible that they were able to do it.

**[01:31:37]** And it's a interesting puzzle

**[01:31:39]** for how China can do it domestically

**[01:31:41]** and how US can do it domestically.

**[01:31:43]** And it seems like there's increasing urgency on that.

**[01:31:46]** And I think if we look out in the next a hundred years,

**[01:31:51]** the urgency is good

**[01:31:52]** because it's probably good for each individual country

**[01:31:55]** to be manufacturing majority of their chips, right?

**[01:31:59]** It's less likely to lead to conflict.


### [01:32:00 - 01:33:00]

**[01:32:03]** - Well, this is the trend that you need

**[01:32:06]** to manufacturing things that are important

**[01:32:08]** for national security.

**[01:32:10]** It's not efficient, but it's so-called strategically safer.

**[01:32:15]** - You mentioned one child policy,

**[01:32:16]** so can we speak a little bit more to that?

**[01:32:18]** Like what broadly,

**[01:32:20]** what impact has it had on the Chinese society?

**[01:32:23]** On culture, you already mentioned some of it,

**[01:32:26]** some of the impact on the economics, on the culture,

**[01:32:30]** on the demographics of China?

**[01:32:33]** - It's probably one of the most radical policies

**[01:32:35]** that China has enacted in its history.

**[01:32:40]** And the enforcement was very strict.

**[01:32:43]** In my class,

**[01:32:45]** nobody had a sibling except my friend who was a (indistinct)

**[01:32:51]** 98% of urban households had only one child.

**[01:32:55]** The other 2% are twins, which you're allowed to keep,

**[01:32:58]** thank goodness,


### [01:33:00 - 01:34:00]

**[01:33:00]** if you had the good fortune of giving birth to twins.

**[01:33:04]** It had lots of unintended consequences on the economy

**[01:33:08]** and society as well.

**[01:33:11]** Maybe on the good side,

**[01:33:13]** it's actually a golden age for Chinese women

**[01:33:16]** because the Chinese girls

**[01:33:18]** never had as much education investment apportioned to them

**[01:33:22]** as they've had after being the only child in the family.

**[01:33:26]** And you raised a daughter like a son.

**[01:33:29]** And if we look at all the skill gaps,

**[01:33:30]** and the education gaps,

**[01:33:32]** and the returns to education, actually girls fared better.

**[01:33:36]** Apart from the top, top, top leadership

**[01:33:40]** in the Chinese political class.

**[01:33:43]** You look at the CEOs and major companies,

**[01:33:48]** in the ministry, civil servants,

**[01:33:50]** there are a lot of Chinese women.

**[01:33:52]** And actually recently, if you look at the surveys,

**[01:33:55]** the Chinese families would prefer to have a daughter

**[01:33:58]** than a son because they've seen


### [01:34:00 - 01:35:00]

**[01:34:01]** how much bargaining power you as a Chinese woman

**[01:34:06]** and as a rare bride or a scarce supply of brides goes,

**[01:34:11]** you have raise your bargaining power

**[01:34:13]** and you can command high amounts of dowry.

**[01:34:15]** That was an unintended good thing

**[01:34:17]** about the one child policy.

**[01:34:20]** And to the opposite,

**[01:34:23]** the recent relaxation of the one child policy,

**[01:34:26]** actually women are now encouraged

**[01:34:27]** to have as many kids as they possibly can.

**[01:34:31]** The flip side of the one child policy has not necessarily

**[01:34:34]** been good to women in the job mar job market

**[01:34:37]** because they think, "Oh, well, you've only had one child.

**[01:34:39]** Oh, guess what, you can have another child."

**[01:34:41]** So that's not necessarily good for long-term employability.

**[01:34:47]** But on the economic side,

**[01:34:50]** I've written about this in my academic papers,

**[01:34:52]** it's been one of the very important causes

**[01:34:56]** of high saving rate.

**[01:34:58]** I always tell people,

**[01:34:58]** you want to stimulate consumption?


### [01:35:00 - 01:36:00]

**[01:35:00]** Well, have more kids.

**[01:35:02]** You know how much one of those costs, right?

**[01:35:04]** Especially in China?

**[01:35:06]** The tutorial-ships, the education,

**[01:35:08]** and they have to buy a house.

**[01:35:09]** You have to buy a house for them

**[01:35:10]** so that they can get married eventually.

**[01:35:13]** So it's very, very expensive to have a child.

**[01:35:16]** If you have more children, you spend more.

**[01:35:19]** But maybe people don't wanna have more children

**[01:35:21]** because the cost of having a child is so high

**[01:35:23]** and this is driven by the competition.

**[01:35:26]** And why is there so much competition?

**[01:35:27]** Because there's a one child policy generation, right?

**[01:35:31]** You want your child to be the dragon or the phoenix,

**[01:35:35]** and you put everything into that one child,

**[01:35:38]** that makes the child more anxious,

**[01:35:41]** makes the whole environment more competitive.

**[01:35:44]** And in the end,

**[01:35:45]** these one child policy children

**[01:35:47]** don't wanna have a lot of kids

**[01:35:49]** because they don't wanna them to see them suffer

**[01:35:51]** what they have suffered, right?

**[01:35:53]** So there are all these kind of unexpected consequences,

**[01:35:56]** but also changing the social fabric.

**[01:35:58]** I'd like to say that it broke the hierarchy of the family


### [01:36:00 - 01:37:00]

**[01:36:01]** where the parents had the dominant role.

**[01:36:02]** Now the kids are the boss, they boss everybody around,

**[01:36:06]** they boss their grandparents around.

**[01:36:08]** It relates to the puzzle, the housing puzzle.

**[01:36:12]** How is it possible that the Chinese youth

**[01:36:15]** can afford these really expensive real estate

**[01:36:19]** with their meager income?

**[01:36:21]** Well, one common thing is that they have six wallets, right?

**[01:36:24]** You and your spouse, together with the parents,

**[01:36:27]** and maybe even the grandparents would chip in.

**[01:36:29]** So there's this kind of intergenerational

**[01:36:32]** family dynamics that makes our models

**[01:36:37]** focused on the individual consumption

**[01:36:39]** just completely inappropriate to describe these dynamics.

**[01:36:45]** But the demographic side is the other challenge,

**[01:36:52]** which is they were so strict about the one child policy

**[01:36:58]** and they kept it in for too long,


### [01:37:00 - 01:38:00]

**[01:37:01]** so that once they decide to loosen it

**[01:37:04]** and decided that fertility rates were way too low

**[01:37:08]** to sustain the Chinese economy and its future,

**[01:37:10]** it was already too late.

**[01:37:13]** And now it's finding all kinds of creative ways

**[01:37:16]** to make people have more kids.

**[01:37:17]** This is not something that they can demand and command

**[01:37:21]** in ways that they can demand and command

**[01:37:24]** emerging strategic sectors, right?

**[01:37:26]** So all these really interesting social anecdotes

**[01:37:30]** where they're encouraging even single women,

**[01:37:33]** in a highly conservative society,

**[01:37:35]** encouraging single women to raise children.

**[01:37:37]** Nothing to be afraid about that,

**[01:37:39]** lots of support system going there.

**[01:37:42]** I mean, they're radically changing

**[01:37:44]** the whole thinking around these kind of issues.

**[01:37:47]** - Well, it seems like even the West,

**[01:37:48]** a lot of the developed countries

**[01:37:51]** have a demographics problem.

**[01:37:54]** Seems like a lot of countries not have enough babies.

**[01:37:56]** - [Keyu] South Korea-

**[01:37:58]** - [Lex] South Korea.

**[01:37:59]** - Very, very, very low fertility rate.


### [01:38:00 - 01:39:00]

**[01:38:01]** It's just that for China's stage of development,

**[01:38:05]** it should be having more babies than it is currently having.

**[01:38:08]** So the one child policy accelerated

**[01:38:11]** that demographic transition, right?

**[01:38:13]** It really squeezed in many, many decades into two.

**[01:38:18]** But my view about the demographic aspects for the economy

**[01:38:25]** is not as pessimistic as most people,

**[01:38:28]** because meanwhile we're talking about aging,

**[01:38:34]** there are also high rates of unemployment, right?

**[01:38:39]** When we're talking about

**[01:38:42]** is there enough people to do the jobs?

**[01:38:45]** We have things like AI.

**[01:38:47]** And not enough jobs,

**[01:38:48]** and these kind of questions that are first order.

**[01:38:53]** We haven't even figured out the relationship

**[01:38:55]** between labor force productivity,

**[01:38:58]** what are the factors of production


### [01:39:00 - 01:40:00]

**[01:39:00]** that will be most important for future economy?

**[01:39:04]** And so we shouldn't be terrified

**[01:39:06]** that there's a looming aging problem

**[01:39:08]** because I think the more important question

**[01:39:10]** is that skill gap, right?

**[01:39:13]** What kind of skills do we actually need in the economy?

**[01:39:16]** What kind of education system should we design

**[01:39:19]** in the economy to better suit the country

**[01:39:22]** to an ever evolving

**[01:39:24]** and transformative technological society?

**[01:39:27]** - Because if that's successful,

**[01:39:28]** then we'd be able to respond to whatever puzzle

**[01:39:31]** the demographic situation creates.

**[01:39:33]** - Yeah.

**[01:39:34]** If you look at the most recent evidence on this issue,

**[01:39:37]** they found that post-1990, aging economies became richer,

**[01:39:44]** not the other way around,

**[01:39:46]** which was true for the pre-1990 sample.

**[01:39:48]** And the reason is that these aging societies

**[01:39:51]** much more rapidly adopted new technologies, automation,

**[01:39:56]** that actually help the entire economy.

**[01:39:59]** So should we be panicking about this now


### [01:40:00 - 01:41:00]

**[01:40:01]** when we're actually also panicking about the fact

**[01:40:03]** there are not enough jobs around?

**[01:40:06]** There are other issues that are more relevant

**[01:40:10]** for the Chinese economy today.

**[01:40:11]** - There are constant predictions

**[01:40:13]** of China's economy collapsing.

**[01:40:15]** You have pushed against that narrative.

**[01:40:18]** But you've also spoken to some

**[01:40:19]** of the challenges it's going through.

**[01:40:23]** What's the GDP gonna look like?

**[01:40:25]** Is the Chinese economy gonna collapse?

**[01:40:27]** Is it gonna flourish?

**[01:40:29]** What do you think?

**[01:40:31]** - Collapse is such a strong word,

**[01:40:34]** and the West has been using this word repeatedly.

**[01:40:38]** If I remember correctly, maybe four to five times,

**[01:40:41]** maybe even six times since 1980s

**[01:40:44]** during the period of China's fastest growth.

**[01:40:48]** I tend to not think that Chinese economy will collapse,

**[01:40:52]** but will the slow down continue?

**[01:40:54]** Will it be able to lift up again?

**[01:40:57]** Will it be able to come out of this cycle soon?


### [01:41:00 - 01:42:00]

**[01:41:02]** I think that's more relevant.

**[01:41:04]** And the Chinese economy has a lot of potential

**[01:41:09]** because the fundamentals are still there, right?

**[01:41:11]** When we talk about the fundamentals, it's the skills,

**[01:41:13]** it's the human capital, it's the physical capital,

**[01:41:17]** it's the macroeconomic stability and political stability.

**[01:41:20]** That's a lot going for a country

**[01:41:23]** if you look around the world right now, right?

**[01:41:25]** And this is why the entrepreneurialism is still there

**[01:41:29]** because the fundamentals are there,

**[01:41:30]** even though the economy is weak,

**[01:41:32]** consumers are not confident,

**[01:41:33]** and private investment is insufficient.

**[01:41:35]** The fundamentals are there.

**[01:41:37]** Is China where it should be?

**[01:41:39]** Far, far, far from it.

**[01:41:41]** Because China's potential, based on the fundamentals,

**[01:41:45]** is a much higher level of per capita income

**[01:41:48]** than where it is currently.

**[01:41:49]** It's kind of currently in a $10,000 bracket.

**[01:41:52]** And this is also a puzzle

**[01:41:54]** because you're a $10,000 per capita income country

**[01:41:57]** that can actually do leading edge technology,

**[01:41:59]** and can be neck to neck with US companies


### [01:42:00 - 01:43:00]

**[01:42:03]** on these high tech.

**[01:42:04]** That's the first time in history.

**[01:42:06]** Even the Soviet Union,

**[01:42:07]** which was very technologically advanced,

**[01:42:09]** did not have the extent

**[01:42:10]** of commercializable civilian technology

**[01:42:13]** and the technologies

**[01:42:15]** that were pervasive throughout the economy.

**[01:42:17]** But fundamentally,

**[01:42:19]** we have to understand how much of this real estate crisis

**[01:42:23]** has impinged on the economy

**[01:42:25]** and explains the persistent slowdown.

**[01:42:29]** - Can you explain the real estate crisis?

**[01:42:32]** - A few years ago there was a crackdown

**[01:42:35]** on the real estate sector.

**[01:42:37]** And again, it comes back to a lot of the social issues

**[01:42:42]** we were discussing.

**[01:42:43]** Why aren't people having kids?

**[01:42:45]** Well, maybe it's because housing is too expensive.

**[01:42:48]** Maybe it's because education system is too competitive.

**[01:42:52]** The speculative bubbles in the real estate

**[01:42:55]** is making housing unaffordable and that's not part

**[01:42:57]** of the Chinese social characteristics, right?


### [01:43:00 - 01:44:00]

**[01:43:01]** And so when they decided that the property investors

**[01:43:06]** were gonna be reigned in,

**[01:43:07]** that housing was to be lived in, not speculated,

**[01:43:11]** it really brought down the whole sector

**[01:43:13]** in terms of investment,

**[01:43:15]** in terms of the financing of the sector.

**[01:43:19]** But ultimately, it made such a massive impact

**[01:43:23]** or such a massive dent on the economy

**[01:43:25]** because it really embodied the two fundamental pillars

**[01:43:30]** of the economy.

**[01:43:31]** One is the fiscal system, and one is the financial system.

**[01:43:35]** So coming back to our local mayor economy,

**[01:43:38]** where did you think the local mayors got their funds?

**[01:43:41]** Through real estate.

**[01:43:43]** They sold land, real estate property developers came in,

**[01:43:47]** they can develop the entire local economy

**[01:43:50]** because the services will come in, the jobs will come in.

**[01:43:52]** And by the way, you are an equity owner of the entire city.

**[01:43:56]** So you want these property developers around.


### [01:44:00 - 01:45:00]

**[01:44:03]** Many countries throughout history

**[01:44:06]** all have this property transition, right?

**[01:44:09]** You need to wean the economy off of property.

**[01:44:13]** In a good situation it takes three to five years,

**[01:44:17]** in a bad situation it can take 10 years.

**[01:44:20]** I don't know where China belongs currently.

**[01:44:25]** But the real estate collapse

**[01:44:28]** also meant the local finances,

**[01:44:30]** local government finances also shrunk dramatically.

**[01:44:33]** Real estate was a really important part

**[01:44:35]** of the financial industry.

**[01:44:37]** It brought that down.

**[01:44:38]** Together, it really had a major impact on the economy,

**[01:44:41]** but also from the consumer side,

**[01:44:44]** their wealth was primarily tied into real estate.

**[01:44:47]** Not the stock market,

**[01:44:48]** not other kind of investment opportunities,

**[01:44:50]** it was real estate.

**[01:44:51]** So they felt poor, they consumed less.

**[01:44:54]** - So in the spirit of understanding China better,

**[01:44:57]** maybe to get a bit of your advice, if I were to visit China,


### [01:45:00 - 01:46:00]

**[01:45:02]** what's the right way to visit to experience it,

**[01:45:06]** to see the people,

**[01:45:07]** to talk to the people maybe outside of the big cities?

**[01:45:09]** Is there any advice you can give to somebody going to China?

**[01:45:12]** - Checkout Speed,

**[01:45:17]** his travels into China.

**[01:45:20]** I think they represent a more dynamic reality

**[01:45:27]** than just visiting Beijing, and Shanghai, and Shenzhen,

**[01:45:30]** the big cities.

**[01:45:31]** I actually think a lot of the opportunities,

**[01:45:33]** especially economic opportunities,

**[01:45:35]** are in the second, third tier cities now in China.

**[01:45:38]** And there's a return of talent.

**[01:45:42]** These companies, Pop Mart,

**[01:45:46]** they're coming from these second tier cities

**[01:45:49]** that care about the local economy,

**[01:45:52]** about fun, entertainment.

**[01:45:55]** That's what the new generation is about.

**[01:45:57]** They don't wanna be lining up some factory


### [01:46:00 - 01:47:00]

**[01:46:00]** doing manufacturing jobs.

**[01:46:02]** If you think that the Chinese new generation

**[01:46:04]** is still all about that,

**[01:46:06]** you should really study them a little bit more.

**[01:46:09]** They're all about making their lives more fun

**[01:46:13]** and more interesting, right?

**[01:46:14]** That's the cycle, right?

**[01:46:16]** In the beginning, Chinese people are hungry,

**[01:46:17]** they wanna look for jobs and they find these jobs

**[01:46:20]** in the manufacturing now,

**[01:46:21]** they wanna work-life balance.

**[01:46:23]** They are a spearheading fashion, right?

**[01:46:26]** They spend so much more on entertainment, travel,

**[01:46:31]** clothing, restaurants.

**[01:46:34]** They have come out with these amazing coffee chains

**[01:46:37]** that have beaten completely Starbucks

**[01:46:39]** within a very short amount of time.

**[01:46:41]** This is all the new generation.

**[01:46:44]** Where are the opportunities?

**[01:46:45]** It's in the local areas.

**[01:46:47]** It's all about localism, not globalism, localism.

**[01:46:50]** Being rooted in your local economy,

**[01:46:53]** you'll actually find so many more opportunities.

**[01:46:57]** You go to Chongqing.

**[01:46:58]** I actually was watching a video about Chongqing.


### [01:47:00 - 01:48:00]

**[01:47:01]** I thought we were in Shanghai.

**[01:47:02]** I was so surprised.

**[01:47:04]** And you go to Chengdu, it's fun,

**[01:47:07]** people work a little bit less, but it's really exciting.

**[01:47:11]** It's very fun.

**[01:47:12]** People are really nice.

**[01:47:14]** Go to Xinjiang, take a look for yourself.

**[01:47:17]** There's ski resorts being opened there.

**[01:47:21]** You have a very interesting, colorful,

**[01:47:23]** dynamic complex country,

**[01:47:25]** and it's not defined by Beijing and Shanghai.

**[01:47:28]** - So the small cities are flourishing

**[01:47:31]** and are developing a personality of their own.

**[01:47:33]** - They are flourishing more

**[01:47:35]** than the first major tier cities.

**[01:47:37]** - Interesting.

**[01:47:39]** What's the most beautiful thing to you about China

**[01:47:42]** and its people that you wish more people knew?

**[01:47:46]** - Behind all this competition and the ambition,

**[01:47:50]** you have a very genuine group of people.

**[01:47:53]** They are funny.

**[01:47:58]** They're community based.


### [01:48:00 - 01:49:00]

**[01:48:00]** They are authentic.

**[01:48:01]** Actually, it's not contradictory, right?

**[01:48:05]** You have a society which is heavily controlled,

**[01:48:08]** but they find ways to be truly, truly authentic.

**[01:48:14]** And ultimately,

**[01:48:17]** they're just a very social group, right?

**[01:48:19]** Again, I keep on coming to this being lonely aspect

**[01:48:24]** of the Western society and increasingly living alone.

**[01:48:28]** That is not China.

**[01:48:29]** It's still a very, very warm country,

**[01:48:33]** and they're warm to foreigners, and they are friendly.

**[01:48:39]** - Well, I'm very grateful for you being a voice of balance,

**[01:48:44]** a voice of reason in this world,

**[01:48:46]** and for the book you've written in China

**[01:48:48]** that a lot of people deeply respect.

**[01:48:50]** And for talking today.
