**[01:37:08]** Google have pioneered. If we try to go and build a building that looks like

**[01:37:09]** and build a building that looks like

**[01:37:10]** and build a building that looks like that, we will fail. they're too smart,

**[01:37:12]** that, we will fail. they're too smart,

**[01:37:12]** that, we will fail. they're too smart, they're too capitalized, they're too

**[01:37:14]** they're too capitalized, they're too

**[01:37:14]** they're too capitalized, they're too good, they're too big, they'll get the

**[01:37:16]** good, they're too big, they'll get the

**[01:37:16]** good, they're too big, they'll get the best deals, and we'll just be shut out.

**[01:37:18]** best deals, and we'll just be shut out.

**[01:37:18]** best deals, and we'll just be shut out. And so what we did was we took a very

**[01:37:21]** And so what we did was we took a very

**[01:37:21]** And so what we did was we took a very different architectural approach. We

**[01:37:23]** different architectural approach. We

**[01:37:23]** different architectural approach. We took a very conservative process

**[01:37:24]** took a very conservative process

**[01:37:24]** took a very conservative process technology. We weren't pushing the

**[01:37:26]** technology. We weren't pushing the

**[01:37:26]** technology. We weren't pushing the boundaries of physics and we used a lot

**[01:37:29]** boundaries of physics and we used a lot

**[01:37:29]** boundaries of physics and we used a lot of what's called SRAMM, so memory on the

**[01:37:31]** of what's called SRAMM, so memory on the

**[01:37:31]** of what's called SRAMM, so memory on the chip so that we could do this decode

**[01:37:33]** chip so that we could do this decode

**[01:37:33]** chip so that we could do this decode thing as well or better than everybody

**[01:37:35]** thing as well or better than everybody

**[01:37:35]** thing as well or better than everybody else. And so now when you put these two

**[01:37:37]** else. And so now when you put these two

**[01:37:37]** else. And so now when you put these two things together, I just think it's going

**[01:37:39]** things together, I just think it's going

**[01:37:39]** things together, I just think it's going to create

**[01:37:40]** to create

**[01:37:40]** to create a huge acceleration in

**[01:37:44]** a huge acceleration in

**[01:37:44]** a huge acceleration in the ability for this entire

**[01:37:46]** the ability for this entire

**[01:37:46]** the ability for this entire infrastructure layer to get much cheaper

**[01:37:48]** infrastructure layer to get much cheaper

**[01:37:48]** infrastructure layer to get much cheaper and much more valuable, which I suspect

**[01:37:51]** and much more valuable, which I suspect

**[01:37:51]** and much more valuable, which I suspect then it'll have a lot more developer

**[01:37:53]** then it'll have a lot more developer

**[01:37:54]** then it'll have a lot more developer pull. You'll get a lot more applications

**[01:37:56]** pull. You'll get a lot more applications

**[01:37:56]** pull. You'll get a lot more applications being built, billions and billions of

**[01:37:59]** being built, billions and billions of

**[01:37:59]** being built, billions and billions of more people using it. So think about it


### [01:38:00 - 01:39:00]

**[01:38:02]** more people using it. So think about it

**[01:38:02]** more people using it. So think about it as pre-filled decode. We were really

**[01:38:04]** as pre-filled decode. We were really

**[01:38:04]** as pre-filled decode. We were really great at decode and I think partnering

**[01:38:06]** great at decode and I think partnering

**[01:38:06]** great at decode and I think partnering up was the strategic rational. And so

**[01:38:08]** up was the strategic rational. And so

**[01:38:08]** up was the strategic rational. And so essentially what happened was last May

**[01:38:09]** essentially what happened was last May

**[01:38:10]** essentially what happened was last May Nvidia announced this thing which

**[01:38:12]** Nvidia announced this thing which

**[01:38:12]** Nvidia announced this thing which allowed their chip to talk to other

**[01:38:14]** allowed their chip to talk to other

**[01:38:14]** allowed their chip to talk to other things and our team reached out and said

**[01:38:17]** things and our team reached out and said

**[01:38:17]** things and our team reached out and said hey can we experiment to see if our chip

**[01:38:19]** hey can we experiment to see if our chip

**[01:38:19]** hey can we experiment to see if our chip could talk to your chip and we could do

**[01:38:22]** could talk to your chip and we could do

**[01:38:22]** could talk to your chip and we could do this thing better. And over the summer

**[01:38:24]** this thing better. And over the summer

**[01:38:24]** this thing better. And over the summer there was some kind of like spreadsheet

**[01:38:26]** there was some kind of like spreadsheet

**[01:38:26]** there was some kind of like spreadsheet work that happened. Then they were

**[01:38:30]** work that happened. Then they were

**[01:38:30]** work that happened. Then they were interested enough where they were like,

**[01:38:31]** interested enough where they were like,

**[01:38:31]** interested enough where they were like, "I'll give you a couple engineers." And

**[01:38:32]** "I'll give you a couple engineers." And

**[01:38:32]** "I'll give you a couple engineers." And Jensen was kind of curious about it.

**[01:38:35]** Jensen was kind of curious about it.

**[01:38:36]** Jensen was kind of curious about it. And then about a month ago, he and I had

**[01:38:38]** And then about a month ago, he and I had

**[01:38:38]** And then about a month ago, he and I had a call on a Saturday and he's like, "I

**[01:38:40]** a call on a Saturday and he's like, "I

**[01:38:40]** a call on a Saturday and he's like, "I think this thing is really real."

**[01:38:43]** think this thing is really real."

**[01:38:43]** think this thing is really real." And I called Jonathan and Sunny right

**[01:38:45]** And I called Jonathan and Sunny right

**[01:38:45]** And I called Jonathan and Sunny right away and I said, "You should be prepared

**[01:38:47]** away and I said, "You should be prepared

**[01:38:47]** away and I said, "You should be prepared that if this thing works, there's going

**[01:38:52]** here." And one thing led to another and

**[01:38:52]** here." And one thing led to another and they acted decisively. Here's what I'll

**[01:38:53]** they acted decisively. Here's what I'll

**[01:38:53]** they acted decisively. Here's what I'll tell you about Jensen. to seeing a
