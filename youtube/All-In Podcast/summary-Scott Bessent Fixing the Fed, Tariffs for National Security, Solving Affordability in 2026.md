## Executive Summary

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent provides a comprehensive year-one review of the Trump administration's economic policies and outlines ambitious plans for 2026. The wide-ranging discussion covers fiscal deficit reduction (from 6.8% to mid-5% of GDP), tariffs as national security tools rather than purely revenue mechanisms, fundamental Fed reform to reduce its outsized role in the economy, and innovative initiatives like Trump accounts to promote equity ownership. Bessent emphasizes that 2025 was about "setting the table" while 2026 will deliver the "banquet" - with affordability improvements, capex acceleration, and tax relief for working Americans through no-tax policies on tips, overtime, and Social Security.

3. **Fed Mission Creep**: From 1913 lender of last resort to three-headed beast (rates, balance sheet, regulatory); QE continued far too long, becoming engine of inequality

9. **Trump Accounts Revolution**: Every child gets $1,000 equity stake; philanthropic and state top-ups; will close 38% equity ownership gap and shift views on capitalism
10. **2025 vs 2026**: Setting the table done; the banquet arrives in 2026 with capex boom turning into employment boom, tax relief hitting paychecks, and affordability improving
