**[00:30]** My name is Oliver Shu. I'm a partner on

**[00:30]** My name is Oliver Shu. I'm a partner on the American Dynism team here at A16Z.

**[00:33]** the American Dynism team here at A16Z.

**[00:33]** the American Dynism team here at A16Z. And my big idea is that advances in AI

**[00:36]** And my big idea is that advances in AI

**[00:36]** And my big idea is that advances in AI reasoning capabilities and in robot

**[00:38]** reasoning capabilities and in robot

**[00:38]** reasoning capabilities and in robot learning will help accelerate scientific

**[00:41]** learning will help accelerate scientific

**[00:41]** learning will help accelerate scientific progress by moving us closer towards

**[00:43]** progress by moving us closer towards

**[00:43]** progress by moving us closer towards autonomous labs. Laboratory automation

**[00:45]** autonomous labs. Laboratory automation

**[00:45]** autonomous labs. Laboratory automation is something that's existed for a long

**[00:47]** is something that's existed for a long

**[00:47]** is something that's existed for a long time. Like that is not new. This idea of

**[00:50]** time. Like that is not new. This idea of

**[00:50]** time. Like that is not new. This idea of having robots that you [music] can

**[00:51]** having robots that you [music] can

**[00:51]** having robots that you [music] can pre-program to assist in some of the

**[00:54]** pre-program to assist in some of the

**[00:54]** pre-program to assist in some of the motions involved in a lab. What is new

**[00:57]** motions involved in a lab. What is new

**[00:57]** motions involved in a lab. What is new and what is emerging right now is the


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** and what is emerging right now is the

**[01:01]** and what is emerging right now is the combination of reasoning capabilities

**[01:04]** combination of reasoning capabilities

**[01:04]** combination of reasoning capabilities um and experiment planning and uh the

**[01:08]** um and experiment planning and uh the

**[01:08]** um and experiment planning and uh the physical element of lab automation. So

**[01:11]** physical element of lab automation. So

**[01:11]** physical element of lab automation. So what that might look like in the near

**[01:12]** what that might look like in the near

**[01:12]** what that might look like in the near term is collaboration between a

**[01:15]** term is collaboration between a

**[01:15]** term is collaboration between a scientist and a system that involves

**[01:18]** scientist and a system that involves

**[01:18]** scientist and a system that involves both an AI application and a robot.

**[01:20]** both an AI application and a robot.

**[01:20]** both an AI application and a robot. [music]

**[01:21]** [music]

**[01:21]** [music] Um and having that be a much more

**[01:23]** Um and having that be a much more

**[01:23]** Um and having that be a much more collaborative process uh in the near

**[01:25]** collaborative process uh in the near

**[01:25]** collaborative process uh in the near term in many different kinds of labs and

**[01:28]** term in many different kinds of labs and

**[01:28]** term in many different kinds of labs and many different kinds of scientific

**[01:29]** many different kinds of scientific

**[01:29]** many different kinds of scientific processes whether that's in the life

**[01:31]** processes whether that's in the life

**[01:31]** processes whether that's in the life sciences in the chemicals industry in

**[01:33]** sciences in the chemicals industry in

**[01:33]** sciences in the chemicals industry in the material science uh research sphere

**[01:35]** the material science uh research sphere

**[01:36]** the material science uh research sphere uh and so on and so forth. One of the

**[01:37]** uh and so on and so forth. One of the

**[01:37]** uh and so on and so forth. One of the things that I think is important in the

**[01:40]** things that I think is important in the

**[01:40]** things that I think is important in the near term though is around

**[01:41]** near term though is around

**[01:41]** near term though is around interpretability. So, you know, if you

**[01:44]** interpretability. So, you know, if you

**[01:44]** interpretability. So, you know, if you think about AI systems as

**[01:46]** think about AI systems as

**[01:46]** think about AI systems as non-deterministic [music]

**[01:46]** non-deterministic [music]

**[01:46]** non-deterministic [music] computers, one of the things that really

**[01:48]** computers, one of the things that really

**[01:48]** computers, one of the things that really matters for research is you want to

**[01:53]** matters for research is you want to

**[01:53]** matters for research is you want to really understand why the system is

**[01:55]** really understand why the system is

**[01:55]** really understand why the system is doing what it's doing, why it's planning

**[01:57]** doing what it's doing, why it's planning

**[01:57]** doing what it's doing, why it's planning [music] on uh iterating on an experiment


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:01]** [music] on uh iterating on an experiment

**[02:01]** [music] on uh iterating on an experiment in a given way, why it's planning on

**[02:03]** in a given way, why it's planning on

**[02:03]** in a given way, why it's planning on doing this particular thing. And I think

**[02:05]** doing this particular thing. And I think

**[02:05]** doing this particular thing. And I think uh you know systems that are

**[02:06]** uh you know systems that are

**[02:06]** uh you know systems that are purpose-built for scientific research

**[02:09]** purpose-built for scientific research

**[02:09]** purpose-built for scientific research are probably going to focus a lot on

**[02:12]** are probably going to focus a lot on

**[02:12]** are probably going to focus a lot on that on the interpretability on

**[02:13]** that on the interpretability on

**[02:13]** that on the interpretability on recording what exactly is is uh is

**[02:17]** recording what exactly is is uh is

**[02:17]** recording what exactly is is uh is happening throughout each step of the

**[02:19]** happening throughout each step of the

**[02:19]** happening throughout each step of the process as it collaborates with a human

**[02:20]** process as it collaborates with a human

**[02:20]** process as it collaborates with a human scientist. I think this concept of fully

**[02:23]** scientist. I think this concept of fully

**[02:23]** scientist. I think this concept of fully self-driving science, right, like a a

**[02:25]** self-driving science, right, like a a

**[02:25]** self-driving science, right, like a a closed loop where you have AI that

**[02:29]** closed loop where you have AI that

**[02:29]** closed loop where you have AI that iterates on itself and then carries out

**[02:31]** iterates on itself and then carries out

**[02:31]** iterates on itself and then carries out an experiment, then continues to to to

**[02:33]** an experiment, then continues to to to

**[02:33]** an experiment, then continues to to to iterate without human intervention. I

**[02:36]** iterate without human intervention. I

**[02:36]** iterate without human intervention. I think this is further out. This is what

**[02:38]** think this is further out. This is what

**[02:38]** think this is further out. This is what I would consider the destination uh for

**[02:40]** I would consider the destination uh for

**[02:40]** I would consider the destination uh for this idea of of autonomous science.

**[02:44]** this idea of of autonomous science.

**[02:44]** this idea of of autonomous science. I think where we are right now is that

**[02:46]** I think where we are right now is that

**[02:46]** I think where we are right now is that there's a lot of work being done uh to

**[02:50]** there's a lot of work being done uh to

**[02:50]** there's a lot of work being done uh to form the foundations of autonomous

**[02:53]** form the foundations of autonomous

**[02:53]** form the foundations of autonomous science and there uh if you consider

**[02:56]** science and there uh if you consider

**[02:56]** science and there uh if you consider science as you know broadly speaking

**[02:59]** science as you know broadly speaking

**[02:59]** science as you know broadly speaking some combination of theory of


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** some combination of theory of

**[03:01]** some combination of theory of computation and of experimentation

**[03:05]** computation and of experimentation

**[03:05]** computation and of experimentation there's work being done in the AI

**[03:07]** there's work being done in the AI

**[03:07]** there's work being done in the AI ecosystem across areas like mathematical

**[03:10]** ecosystem across areas like mathematical

**[03:10]** ecosystem across areas like mathematical reasoning uh physical reasoning

**[03:13]** reasoning uh physical reasoning

**[03:13]** reasoning uh physical reasoning simulation and world models and robot

**[03:16]** simulation and world models and robot

**[03:16]** simulation and world models and robot learning and all of these things

**[03:18]** learning and all of these things

**[03:18]** learning and all of these things eventually [music] as these capabilities

**[03:20]** eventually [music] as these capabilities

**[03:20]** eventually [music] as these capabilities improve can be applied to uh closing

**[03:24]** improve can be applied to uh closing

**[03:24]** improve can be applied to uh closing this loop. But progress across all these

**[03:27]** this loop. But progress across all these

**[03:27]** this loop. But progress across all these fields is of course uneven and you kind

**[03:30]** fields is of course uneven and you kind

**[03:30]** fields is of course uneven and you kind of have to wait for the capabilities to

**[03:31]** of have to wait for the capabilities to

**[03:31]** of have to wait for the capabilities to get to the point where um they're ready

**[03:34]** get to the point where um they're ready

**[03:34]** get to the point where um they're ready to be applied to this close this closed

**[03:37]** to be applied to this close this closed

**[03:37]** to be applied to this close this closed loop and I think that's the destination

**[03:40]** loop and I think that's the destination

**[03:40]** loop and I think that's the destination and in the near term incrementally we'll

**[03:42]** and in the near term incrementally we'll

**[03:42]** and in the near term incrementally we'll make progress on you know lab automation

**[03:45]** make progress on you know lab automation

**[03:45]** make progress on you know lab automation on the reasoning pieces of this um but

**[03:48]** on the reasoning pieces of this um but

**[03:48]** on the reasoning pieces of this um but uh ultimately the final destination I

**[03:50]** uh ultimately the final destination I

**[03:50]** uh ultimately the final destination I think would be around this idea of a of

**[03:52]** think would be around this idea of a of

**[03:52]** think would be around this idea of a of of a self-driving lab or of autonomous

**[03:55]** of a self-driving lab or of autonomous

**[03:55]** of a self-driving lab or of autonomous science part of this is going to be

**[03:56]** science part of this is going to be

**[03:56]** science part of this is going to be driven by the market dynamic


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** driven by the market dynamic

**[04:00]** driven by the market dynamic uh in which the research is conducted.

**[04:02]** uh in which the research is conducted.

**[04:02]** uh in which the research is conducted. So I think there are certain categories

**[04:04]** So I think there are certain categories

**[04:04]** So I think there are certain categories of science where there is just a much

**[04:06]** of science where there is just a much

**[04:06]** of science where there is just a much more mature

**[04:08]** more mature

**[04:08]** more mature uh demand side market for the outputs of

**[04:11]** uh demand side market for the outputs of

**[04:11]** uh demand side market for the outputs of research and examples include of course

**[04:13]** research and examples include of course

**[04:14]** research and examples include of course life sciences and pharma um the

**[04:16]** life sciences and pharma um the

**[04:16]** life sciences and pharma um the chemicals industry um facets of the uh

**[04:19]** chemicals industry um facets of the uh

**[04:19]** chemicals industry um facets of the uh material science industry. I think these

**[04:22]** material science industry. I think these

**[04:22]** material science industry. I think these are areas where there is a ready

**[04:25]** are areas where there is a ready

**[04:25]** are areas where there is a ready uh and willing buyer for a lot of the

**[04:28]** uh and willing buyer for a lot of the

**[04:28]** uh and willing buyer for a lot of the outputs of this research and the

**[04:32]** outputs of this research and the

**[04:32]** outputs of this research and the uh this the increase in speed and

**[04:34]** uh this the increase in speed and

**[04:34]** uh this the increase in speed and capability uh as well as any cost

**[04:36]** capability uh as well as any cost

**[04:36]** capability uh as well as any cost advantage that might um that might

**[04:39]** advantage that might um that might

**[04:39]** advantage that might um that might occur. All of these things are going to

**[04:41]** occur. All of these things are going to

**[04:41]** occur. All of these things are going to matter more to uh for markets where

**[04:43]** matter more to uh for markets where

**[04:43]** matter more to uh for markets where there is a well-established buyer of of

**[04:45]** there is a well-established buyer of of

**[04:45]** there is a well-established buyer of of of research output. And so I think the

**[04:49]** of research output. And so I think the

**[04:49]** of research output. And so I think the where you see autonomous labs and

**[04:51]** where you see autonomous labs and

**[04:51]** where you see autonomous labs and autonomous science being adopted first

**[04:53]** autonomous science being adopted first

**[04:53]** autonomous science being adopted first is probably more of a function of the

**[04:55]** is probably more of a function of the

**[04:55]** is probably more of a function of the market that um that that that it's

**[04:57]** market that um that that that it's

**[04:57]** market that um that that that it's operating in. I think periodic labs is a

**[04:59]** operating in. I think periodic labs is a

**[04:59]** operating in. I think periodic labs is a great example of uh of a team taking a


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** great example of uh of a team taking a

**[05:02]** great example of uh of a team taking a swing um at uh at autonomous science. I

**[05:06]** swing um at uh at autonomous science. I

**[05:06]** swing um at uh at autonomous science. I think you know when you look at the

**[05:08]** think you know when you look at the

**[05:08]** think you know when you look at the early stage startup landscape there's

**[05:10]** early stage startup landscape there's

**[05:10]** early stage startup landscape there's companies like Medra that are focused on

**[05:12]** companies like Medra that are focused on

**[05:12]** companies like Medra that are focused on the life sciences and uh pharma market.

**[05:15]** the life sciences and uh pharma market.

**[05:15]** the life sciences and uh pharma market. There's companies like uh Chemifi and

**[05:18]** There's companies like uh Chemifi and

**[05:18]** There's companies like uh Chemifi and Yona Labs that are focused on the uh on

**[05:21]** Yona Labs that are focused on the uh on

**[05:21]** Yona Labs that are focused on the uh on on the chemistry industry. Um and then

**[05:24]** on the chemistry industry. Um and then

**[05:24]** on the chemistry industry. Um and then there's zooming out a bit there's

**[05:26]** there's zooming out a bit there's

**[05:26]** there's zooming out a bit there's collaborations between government and

**[05:28]** collaborations between government and

**[05:28]** collaborations between government and industry that are really focused on this

**[05:31]** industry that are really focused on this

**[05:31]** industry that are really focused on this intersection of AI and science. uh you

**[05:33]** intersection of AI and science. uh you

**[05:33]** intersection of AI and science. uh you know there is the genesis mission led by

**[05:36]** know there is the genesis mission led by

**[05:36]** know there is the genesis mission led by the department of energy uh that brings

**[05:38]** the department of energy uh that brings

**[05:38]** the department of energy uh that brings together you know academia, government

**[05:40]** together you know academia, government

**[05:40]** together you know academia, government and the national labs as well as uh

**[05:43]** and the national labs as well as uh

**[05:43]** and the national labs as well as uh leading AI companies uh to pursue

**[05:47]** leading AI companies uh to pursue

**[05:47]** leading AI companies uh to pursue AIdriven science. I think just today

**[05:50]** AIdriven science. I think just today

**[05:50]** AIdriven science. I think just today DeepMind announced a partnership with

**[05:52]** DeepMind announced a partnership with

**[05:52]** DeepMind announced a partnership with the UK government um [music] to

**[05:54]** the UK government um [music] to

**[05:54]** the UK government um [music] to collaborate on areas of scientific

**[05:56]** collaborate on areas of scientific

**[05:56]** collaborate on areas of scientific discovery. So I think there's, you know,

**[05:58]** discovery. So I think there's, you know,

**[05:58]** discovery. So I think there's, you know, there's startups that are working on lab


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[09:39]** looking for companies where AI

**[09:40]** looking for companies where AI reinforces the business [music] model.

**[09:42]** reinforces the business [music] model.

**[09:42]** reinforces the business [music] model. You know, I think there's a lot of

**[09:43]** You know, I think there's a lot of narrative around AI helping automate

**[09:45]** narrative around AI helping automate

**[09:45]** narrative around AI helping automate work and reducing cost. But I think in

**[09:55]** to the amount that customers may want to

**[09:55]** to the amount that customers may want to adopt that technology. And so the market

**[09:58]** adopt that technology. And so the market

**[09:58]** adopt that technology. And so the market pull in examples like that are just,


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** pull in examples like that are just,

**[10:00]** pull in examples like that are just, [music] you know, so much stronger than

**[10:07]** company called EVE, which operates in

**[10:07]** company called EVE, which operates in the plaintiff law space. And what's

**[10:09]** the plaintiff law space. And what's

**[10:09]** the plaintiff law space. And what's unique about plaintiff law is that those

**[10:12]** unique about plaintiff law is that those

**[10:12]** unique about plaintiff law is that those attorneys don't charge by the hour. They

**[10:14]** attorneys don't charge by the hour. They

**[10:27]** enabling them to take on more clients

**[10:27]** enabling them to take on more clients and make more money. So it doesn't
