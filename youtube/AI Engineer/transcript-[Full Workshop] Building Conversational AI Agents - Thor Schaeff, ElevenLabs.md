**[04:28]** working on the version three of the

**[04:28]** working on the version three of the multilingual models. And I do think

**[04:31]** multilingual models. And I do think

**[04:31]** multilingual models. And I do think we'll we'll need to double check. Uh,

**[04:33]** we'll we'll need to double check. Uh,

**[04:33]** we'll we'll need to double check. Uh, not that I promise something wrong, but

**[05:04]** and Tamil. Um so we're working on some

**[05:04]** and Tamil. Um so we're working on some additional languages there. Okay. So we

**[05:05]** additional languages there. Okay. So we

**[05:06]** additional languages there. Okay. So we have a good mix that we can play around

**[05:07]** have a good mix that we can play around

**[05:07]** have a good mix that we can play around with. Um

**[05:09]** with. Um

**[05:09]** with. Um cool. Yeah. If there's any other

**[05:11]** cool. Yeah. If there's any other

**[05:11]** cool. Yeah. If there's any other languages later we can you know kind of

**[05:13]** languages later we can you know kind of

**[05:13]** languages later we can you know kind of explore those as well. U maybe one

**[05:16]** explore those as well. U maybe one

**[05:16]** explore those as well. U maybe one language that probably doesn't get

**[05:18]** language that probably doesn't get

**[05:18]** language that probably doesn't get spoken about um often enough uh is

**[05:21]** spoken about um often enough uh is

**[05:22]** spoken about um often enough uh is barking. Um actually if you uh want to

**[05:25]** barking. Um actually if you uh want to

**[05:25]** barking. Um actually if you uh want to build applications for the 900 million

**[05:28]** build applications for the 900 million

**[05:28]** build applications for the 900 million dogs that are out there uh I actually

**[05:30]** dogs that are out there uh I actually

**[05:30]** dogs that are out there uh I actually looked this up. Uh you can use our

**[05:33]** looked this up. Uh you can use our

**[05:33]** looked this up. Uh you can use our model. So this is our most recent

**[05:34]** model. So this is our most recent

**[05:34]** model. So this is our most recent launch. Um uh two months ago now I

**[05:37]** launch. Um uh two months ago now I

**[05:37]** launch. Um uh two months ago now I believe uh the the newest model we

**[05:39]** believe uh the the newest model we

**[05:39]** believe uh the the newest model we launched. So maybe we can can have a

**[05:41]** launched. So maybe we can can have a

**[05:41]** launched. So maybe we can can have a little listen. Uh the daxund is my

**[05:43]** little listen. Uh the daxund is my

**[05:43]** little listen. Uh the daxund is my favorite actually.

**[05:54]** Um, the golden retriever bit more

**[05:54]** Um, the golden retriever bit more and


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** yeah, that one's a bit bit feisty. But

**[06:00]** yeah, that one's a bit bit feisty. But um, yeah, if you're building application

**[06:02]** um, yeah, if you're building application

**[06:02]** um, yeah, if you're building application for dogs, that might be a great use case

**[06:05]** for dogs, that might be a great use case

**[06:05]** for dogs, that might be a great use case for you. Um, did anyone see this launch

**[06:08]** for you. Um, did anyone see this launch

**[06:08]** for you. Um, did anyone see this launch like two months ago? No. Yeah, you saw

**[06:11]** like two months ago? No. Yeah, you saw

**[06:11]** like two months ago? No. Yeah, you saw us. Um, yeah. Yeah, the unfortunate

**[06:13]** us. Um, yeah. Yeah, the unfortunate

**[06:13]** us. Um, yeah. Yeah, the unfortunate thing is we launched it uh 1st of April

**[06:17]** thing is we launched it uh 1st of April

**[06:17]** thing is we launched it uh 1st of April actually and so everyone thought it was

**[06:19]** actually and so everyone thought it was

**[06:19]** actually and so everyone thought it was in April Fools. Um so the timing was a

**[06:22]** in April Fools. Um so the timing was a

**[06:22]** in April Fools. Um so the timing was a bit unfortunate on that one. Um but as

**[06:24]** bit unfortunate on that one. Um but as

**[06:24]** bit unfortunate on that one. Um but as you can see, you know, text to bark,

**[06:26]** you can see, you know, text to bark,

**[06:26]** you can see, you know, text to bark, it's very real. Uh no, in fact, it was

**[06:29]** it's very real. Uh no, in fact, it was

**[06:29]** it's very real. Uh no, in fact, it was an April Fools. So be careful when you

**[06:31]** an April Fools. So be careful when you

**[06:32]** an April Fools. So be careful when you play this to your dog. They might get

**[06:34]** play this to your dog. They might get

**[06:34]** play this to your dog. They might get offended. um because the context we

**[06:37]** offended. um because the context we

**[06:37]** offended. um because the context we can't guarantee that it translates but

**[06:39]** can't guarantee that it translates but

**[06:39]** can't guarantee that it translates but the actual sounds that you're hearing

**[06:41]** the actual sounds that you're hearing

**[06:41]** the actual sounds that you're hearing are generated by our sound effects

**[06:44]** are generated by our sound effects

**[06:44]** are generated by our sound effects model. So we do have a a model if you go

**[06:47]** model. So we do have a a model if you go

**[06:47]** model. So we do have a a model if you go to the app um there is this uh sound

**[06:51]** to the app um there is this uh sound

**[06:51]** to the app um there is this uh sound effects model here um and you can

**[06:53]** effects model here um and you can

**[06:53]** effects model here um and you can actually

**[06:55]** actually

**[06:55]** actually this sound effect was also created

**[06:58]** this sound effect was also created

**[06:58]** this sound effect was also created but so truck reversing u maybe that's a


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** but so truck reversing u maybe that's a

**[07:00]** but so truck reversing u maybe that's a good one you can click generate um and

**[07:03]** good one you can click generate um and

**[07:04]** good one you can click generate um and so basically what we do is we generate

**[07:07]** so basically what we do is we generate

**[07:07]** so basically what we do is we generate kind of four different samples for you

**[07:09]** kind of four different samples for you

**[07:09]** kind of four different samples for you that you can use so um you know not not

**[07:12]** that you can use so um you know not not

**[07:12]** that you can use so um you know not not so interesting for your conversations

**[07:14]** so interesting for your conversations

**[07:14]** so interesting for your conversations per say but like you know if you're

**[07:17]** per say but like you know if you're

**[07:17]** per say but like you know if you're creating video games for example I don't

**[07:19]** creating video games for example I don't

**[07:19]** creating video games for example I don't know if anyone um is doing that we might

**[07:22]** know if anyone um is doing that we might

**[07:22]** know if anyone um is doing that we might be having some uh internet I hope we

**[07:25]** be having some uh internet I hope we

**[07:26]** be having some uh internet I hope we have internet no okay the internet is

**[07:29]** have internet no okay the internet is

**[07:29]** have internet no okay the internet is looking okay

**[07:31]** looking okay

**[07:31]** looking okay so yeah not sure what's happening here

**[07:34]** so yeah not sure what's happening here

**[07:34]** so yeah not sure what's happening here but so for example this was like a

**[07:37]** but so for example this was like a

**[07:37]** but so for example this was like a drum cowbell I I generated recently um

**[07:41]** drum cowbell I I generated recently um

**[07:41]** drum cowbell I I generated recently um actually we do have um if you Google 11

**[07:45]** actually we do have um if you Google 11

**[07:45]** actually we do have um if you Google 11 Labs sound um board. Uh we built this

**[07:49]** Labs sound um board. Uh we built this

**[07:49]** Labs sound um board. Uh we built this recently which was which is pretty cool.

**[07:51]** recently which was which is pretty cool.

**[07:51]** recently which was which is pretty cool. Um so you can kind of loop uh is

**[07:54]** Um so you can kind of loop uh is

**[07:54]** Um so you can kind of loop uh is basically like a drum machine uh and you

**[07:57]** basically like a drum machine uh and you

**[07:57]** basically like a drum machine uh and you can get kind of the


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:04]** sound effects.

**[08:04]** sound effects. The drums are pretty nice as well and

**[08:06]** The drums are pretty nice as well and

**[08:06]** The drums are pretty nice as well and and you know they are mapped to like the

**[08:08]** and you know they are mapped to like the

**[08:08]** and you know they are mapped to like the the keys on the keyboard. So you can you

**[08:11]** the keys on the keyboard. So you can you

**[08:11]** the keys on the keyboard. So you can you can play like

**[08:18]** So that's pretty cool. And then you can

**[08:18]** So that's pretty cool. And then you can add kind of new sound effects and stuff,

**[08:21]** add kind of new sound effects and stuff,

**[08:21]** add kind of new sound effects and stuff, you know, just to give you an idea of

**[08:23]** you know, just to give you an idea of

**[08:23]** you know, just to give you an idea of some of the things um that we do. Now,

**[08:27]** some of the things um that we do. Now,

**[08:27]** some of the things um that we do. Now, obviously here, you know, we're talk

**[08:29]** obviously here, you know, we're talk

**[08:29]** obviously here, you know, we're talk we're talking about conversational AI

**[08:31]** we're talking about conversational AI

**[08:31]** we're talking about conversational AI agents. Um and so specifically if we

**[08:33]** agents. Um and so specifically if we

**[08:33]** agents. Um and so specifically if we kind of look at the different components

**[08:35]** kind of look at the different components

**[08:35]** kind of look at the different components that are involved in building

**[08:37]** that are involved in building

**[08:37]** that are involved in building conversational AI agents, we have the

**[08:39]** conversational AI agents, we have the

**[08:39]** conversational AI agents, we have the user um who is speaking you know some

**[08:42]** user um who is speaking you know some

**[08:42]** user um who is speaking you know some language uh and so we need to transcribe

**[08:45]** language uh and so we need to transcribe

**[08:45]** language uh and so we need to transcribe that speech into text. We then feed that

**[08:48]** that speech into text. We then feed that

**[08:48]** that speech into text. We then feed that into a large language model which is

**[08:50]** into a large language model which is

**[08:50]** into a large language model which is kind of acting as the brain um of you

**[08:53]** kind of acting as the brain um of you

**[08:53]** kind of acting as the brain um of you know our agent. So in our case we

**[08:56]** know our agent. So in our case we

**[08:56]** know our agent. So in our case we currently don't build any intelligence

**[08:58]** currently don't build any intelligence

**[08:58]** currently don't build any intelligence model. So we partner with kind of the


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** model. So we partner with kind of the

**[09:00]** model. So we partner with kind of the existing large language models um

**[09:02]** existing large language models um

**[09:02]** existing large language models um providers. So like your GPT40

**[09:05]** providers. So like your GPT40

**[09:05]** providers. So like your GPT40 uh your Google Gemini what have you. Um

**[09:09]** uh your Google Gemini what have you. Um

**[09:09]** uh your Google Gemini what have you. Um and then this large language model which

**[09:11]** and then this large language model which

**[09:11]** and then this large language model which will act as kind of the brain of your

**[09:13]** will act as kind of the brain of your

**[09:13]** will act as kind of the brain of your agent will generate a text output. Uh

**[09:16]** agent will generate a text output. Uh

**[09:16]** agent will generate a text output. Uh and then we basically stream that text

**[09:18]** and then we basically stream that text

**[09:18]** and then we basically stream that text output back into speech. So that is

**[09:21]** output back into speech. So that is

**[09:21]** output back into speech. So that is roughly kind of the the pipeline that we

**[09:23]** roughly kind of the the pipeline that we

**[09:23]** roughly kind of the the pipeline that we have for building conversational AI

**[09:25]** have for building conversational AI

**[09:25]** have for building conversational AI agents. Now with that there is a bunch

**[09:28]** agents. Now with that there is a bunch

**[09:28]** agents. Now with that there is a bunch of system tools that are built in. So

**[09:30]** of system tools that are built in. So

**[09:30]** of system tools that are built in. So for example we have this language

**[09:31]** for example we have this language

**[09:31]** for example we have this language detection system tool which facilitates

**[09:34]** detection system tool which facilitates

**[09:34]** detection system tool which facilitates the language um switching um that that

**[09:36]** the language um switching um that that

**[09:36]** the language um switching um that that we're going to look at in a bit. Uh we

**[09:38]** we're going to look at in a bit. Uh we

**[09:38]** we're going to look at in a bit. Uh we also have you know function calling tool

**[09:40]** also have you know function calling tool

**[09:40]** also have you know function calling tool calling. So um you know if you need to

**[09:43]** calling. So um you know if you need to

**[09:43]** calling. So um you know if you need to give access to kind of specific

**[09:45]** give access to kind of specific

**[09:45]** give access to kind of specific functionality to your agent you can you

**[09:47]** functionality to your agent you can you

**[09:47]** functionality to your agent you can you can do that here as well. And then um

**[09:50]** can do that here as well. And then um

**[09:50]** can do that here as well. And then um you know there's different approaches.

**[09:52]** you know there's different approaches.

**[09:52]** you know there's different approaches. So like if you've seen open AAI real

**[09:54]** So like if you've seen open AAI real

**[09:54]** So like if you've seen open AAI real time for example so this doesn't

**[09:56]** time for example so this doesn't

**[09:56]** time for example so this doesn't actually go through text right so it

**[09:57]** actually go through text right so it

**[09:57]** actually go through text right so it goes sound token to sound token which


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** goes sound token to sound token which

**[10:00]** goes sound token to sound token which has some benefits but what we've seen

**[10:03]** has some benefits but what we've seen

**[10:03]** has some benefits but what we've seen you know for deploying conversational AI

**[10:05]** you know for deploying conversational AI

**[10:06]** you know for deploying conversational AI agents at scale uh and really

**[10:07]** agents at scale uh and really

**[10:08]** agents at scale uh and really understanding you know what is kind of

**[10:09]** understanding you know what is kind of

**[10:09]** understanding you know what is kind of happening so if you're going sound token

**[10:11]** happening so if you're going sound token

**[10:11]** happening so if you're going sound token to sound token you're kind of flying

**[10:13]** to sound token you're kind of flying

**[10:13]** to sound token you're kind of flying blind a little bit so you know you're

**[10:16]** blind a little bit so you know you're

**[10:16]** blind a little bit so you know you're trusting the the model that sort of it

**[10:19]** trusting the the model that sort of it

**[10:19]** trusting the the model that sort of it actually rep replies intelligently

**[10:22]** actually rep replies intelligently

**[10:22]** actually rep replies intelligently um whereas if you're going through text

**[10:24]** um whereas if you're going through text

**[10:24]** um whereas if you're going through text you can uh have you know kind of better

**[10:26]** you can uh have you know kind of better

**[10:26]** you can uh have you know kind of better monitoring and sort of understanding

**[10:28]** monitoring and sort of understanding

**[10:28]** monitoring and sort of understanding what's what's going on um in your

**[10:30]** what's what's going on um in your

**[10:30]** what's what's going on um in your conversation. So while we're also

**[10:32]** conversation. So while we're also

**[10:32]** conversation. So while we're also exploring you know kind of sound to

**[10:33]** exploring you know kind of sound to

**[10:33]** exploring you know kind of sound to sound for kind of the conversational uh

**[10:36]** sound for kind of the conversational uh

**[10:36]** sound for kind of the conversational uh AI agents for now what we found works

**[10:39]** AI agents for now what we found works

**[10:39]** AI agents for now what we found works best is sort of this this pipeline that

**[10:41]** best is sort of this this pipeline that

**[10:41]** best is sort of this this pipeline that we've built. Um and we deploy kind of

**[10:44]** we've built. Um and we deploy kind of

**[10:44]** we've built. Um and we deploy kind of all these uh models very close to each

**[10:47]** all these uh models very close to each

**[10:47]** all these uh models very close to each other to kind of bring down the latency

**[10:49]** other to kind of bring down the latency

**[10:49]** other to kind of bring down the latency as as much as possible. Cool. And so now

**[10:52]** as as much as possible. Cool. And so now

**[10:52]** as as much as possible. Cool. And so now now we can look at kind of the the

**[10:54]** now we can look at kind of the the

**[10:54]** now we can look at kind of the the individual um sort of components within

**[10:56]** individual um sort of components within

**[10:56]** individual um sort of components within that. So for example for speech to text


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** that. So for example for speech to text

**[11:00]** that. So for example for speech to text uh so this is uh actually the the most

**[11:03]** uh so this is uh actually the the most

**[11:03]** uh so this is uh actually the the most recent model we actually launched um you

**[11:05]** recent model we actually launched um you

**[11:05]** recent model we actually launched um you know that wasn't an April Fools and so

**[11:08]** know that wasn't an April Fools and so

**[11:08]** know that wasn't an April Fools and so this is our um speechto text model. So

**[11:11]** this is our um speechto text model. So

**[11:11]** this is our um speechto text model. So our uh automatic speech recognition

**[11:14]** our uh automatic speech recognition

**[11:14]** our uh automatic speech recognition model so ASR um and this works you know

**[11:17]** model so ASR um and this works you know

**[11:17]** model so ASR um and this works you know kind of benchmark leading across 99

**[11:20]** kind of benchmark leading across 99

**[11:20]** kind of benchmark leading across 99 different languages um at the moment. So

**[11:24]** different languages um at the moment. So

**[11:24]** different languages um at the moment. So what this does and you know you can see

**[11:26]** what this does and you know you can see

**[11:26]** what this does and you know you can see sort of the functionality that's built

**[11:27]** sort of the functionality that's built

**[11:28]** sort of the functionality that's built in there. There's you know word level

**[11:30]** in there. There's you know word level

**[11:30]** in there. There's you know word level timestamps there's speaker diorization

**[11:32]** timestamps there's speaker diorization

**[11:32]** timestamps there's speaker diorization um there's audio event tagging so if you

**[11:35]** um there's audio event tagging so if you

**[11:35]** um there's audio event tagging so if you want in your transcript you know cuffing

**[11:38]** want in your transcript you know cuffing

**[11:38]** want in your transcript you know cuffing laughing sort of some of these you know

**[11:40]** laughing sort of some of these you know

**[11:40]** laughing sort of some of these you know audio tags in there you can enable that

**[11:43]** audio tags in there you can enable that

**[11:43]** audio tags in there you can enable that as well uh and it's all kind of within

**[11:45]** as well uh and it's all kind of within

**[11:45]** as well uh and it's all kind of within you know structured API uh responses

**[11:47]** you know structured API uh responses

**[11:47]** you know structured API uh responses which is really nice. So, what you can

**[11:50]** which is really nice. So, what you can

**[11:50]** which is really nice. So, what you can see here is, for example, you know, we

**[11:52]** see here is, for example, you know, we

**[11:52]** see here is, for example, you know, we have a conference call. Quick check-in.

**[11:56]** have a conference call. Quick check-in.

**[11:56]** have a conference call. Quick check-in. Maple Street is a mess. Time to fix it.


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** Maple Street is a mess. Time to fix it.

**[12:00]** Maple Street is a mess. Time to fix it. Totally. Some of those potholes could

**[12:02]** Totally. Some of those potholes could

**[12:02]** Totally. Some of those potholes could swallow a small car or a very brave

**[12:04]** swallow a small car or a very brave

**[12:04]** swallow a small car or a very brave skateboarder. We start next week. So,

**[12:08]** skateboarder. We start next week. So,

**[12:08]** skateboarder. We start next week. So, what you can see here is as we're kind

**[12:10]** what you can see here is as we're kind

**[12:10]** what you can see here is as we're kind of playing this audio, we see that the

**[12:12]** of playing this audio, we see that the

**[12:12]** of playing this audio, we see that the model recognizes the different speakers

**[12:14]** model recognizes the different speakers

**[12:14]** model recognizes the different speakers uh and kind of texts them as speaker

**[12:16]** uh and kind of texts them as speaker

**[12:16]** uh and kind of texts them as speaker one, speaker two. Um, and then we have

**[12:18]** one, speaker two. Um, and then we have

**[12:18]** one, speaker two. Um, and then we have the word level time stamp. So you see as

**[12:20]** the word level time stamp. So you see as

**[12:20]** the word level time stamp. So you see as I play this Jonas 4E timeline. Yep.

**[12:25]** I play this Jonas 4E timeline. Yep.

**[12:25]** I play this Jonas 4E timeline. Yep. Unless the concrete throws a So we can

**[12:28]** Unless the concrete throws a So we can

**[12:28]** Unless the concrete throws a So we can we can highlight the different words

**[12:29]** we can highlight the different words

**[12:30]** we can highlight the different words kind of you know word level um here. So

**[12:33]** kind of you know word level um here. So

**[12:58]** can forward voice messages um or videos

**[12:58]** can forward voice messages um or videos uh to you know the Telegram bot and then


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** uh to you know the Telegram bot and then

**[13:00]** uh to you know the Telegram bot and then you it automatically identifies, okay,

**[13:02]** you it automatically identifies, okay,

**[13:02]** you it automatically identifies, okay, what language is that? And it gives you

**[13:04]** what language is that? And it gives you

**[13:04]** what language is that? And it gives you back the the transcript um of that

**[13:06]** back the the transcript um of that

**[13:06]** back the the transcript um of that message. So you know you know this all

**[13:09]** message. So you know you know this all

**[13:59]** well, um, so I I I actually live in in Singapore. So, if you spend time in


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** Singapore. So, if you spend time in

**[14:01]** Singapore. So, if you spend time in Singapore, you might have heard kind of

**[14:03]** Singapore, you might have heard kind of

**[14:03]** Singapore, you might have heard kind of the Sing English, right? Which is sort

**[14:05]** the Sing English, right? Which is sort

**[14:05]** the Sing English, right? Which is sort of the Singapore English. Go to hell

**[14:07]** of the Singapore English. Go to hell

**[14:16]** right? She never She just put throw the

**[14:16]** right? She never She just put throw the B on the table. Yeah. Anyone understand

**[14:20]** B on the table. Yeah. Anyone understand

**[14:20]** B on the table. Yeah. Anyone understand what's going on? Do we got any

**[14:22]** what's going on? Do we got any

**[14:22]** what's going on? Do we got any Singaporeans in the house? No,

**[14:26]** Singaporeans in the house? No,

**[14:26]** Singaporeans in the house? No, it's not that easy. Even after six years

**[14:28]** it's not that easy. Even after six years

**[14:28]** it's not that easy. Even after six years in Singapore, um I still sometimes

**[14:31]** in Singapore, um I still sometimes

**[14:31]** in Singapore, um I still sometimes struggle with that. So, what we can do

**[14:32]** struggle with that. So, what we can do

**[14:32]** struggle with that. So, what we can do is we can forward it to our

**[14:34]** is we can forward it to our

**[14:34]** is we can forward it to our transcription bot. Uh, we can see. Okay,

**[14:37]** transcription bot. Uh, we can see. Okay,

**[14:38]** transcription bot. Uh, we can see. Okay, it was received. It's transcribing it

**[14:40]** it was received. It's transcribing it

**[14:40]** it was received. It's transcribing it now. And uh, yeah, go to hell, bastard.

**[14:43]** now. And uh, yeah, go to hell, bastard.

**[14:43]** now. And uh, yeah, go to hell, bastard. You know, I asked for a plastic bag. You

**[14:49]** bag for me. So, you can you can see these are kind of the problems we have

**[14:51]** these are kind of the problems we have

**[14:51]** these are kind of the problems we have in uh, Singapore. Now, another accent

**[14:54]** in uh, Singapore. Now, another accent

**[14:54]** in uh, Singapore. Now, another accent that might be a bit challenging.

**[14:57]** that might be a bit challenging.

**[14:57]** that might be a bit challenging. Um, Scottish.


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:22]** No. Okay. No Scottish people here. Um again we can forward it. We can see um

**[15:26]** again we can forward it. We can see um

**[15:26]** again we can forward it. We can see um and so this is this is really cool

**[15:28]** and so this is this is really cool

**[15:28]** and so this is this is really cool actually that um you know even without

**[15:31]** actually that um you know even without

**[15:31]** actually that um you know even without fine-tuning the model it can actually

**[15:33]** fine-tuning the model it can actually

**[15:33]** fine-tuning the model it can actually understand specific accents um quite

**[15:36]** understand specific accents um quite

**[15:36]** understand specific accents um quite well. So you need to know they're trying

**[15:39]** well. So you need to know they're trying

**[15:39]** well. So you need to know they're trying to split up the country and all that and

**[15:41]** to split up the country and all that and

**[15:41]** to split up the country and all that and we don't want that. We want a decent

**[15:42]** we don't want that. We want a decent

**[15:42]** we don't want that. We want a decent council and all and that's basically

**[15:44]** council and all and that's basically

**[15:44]** council and all and that's basically that. There you go. I actually now

**[15:47]** that. There you go. I actually now

**[15:47]** that. There you go. I actually now listen to this so often that I can

**[15:49]** listen to this so often that I can

**[15:49]** listen to this so often that I can actually hear it. Um but yeah, you might

**[15:51]** actually hear it. Um but yeah, you might

**[15:51]** actually hear it. Um but yeah, you might you might not be familiar with it. Now

**[15:53]** you might not be familiar with it. Now

**[15:53]** you might not be familiar with it. Now one example that's maybe a bit um closer

**[15:56]** one example that's maybe a bit um closer

**[15:56]** one example that's maybe a bit um closer to where you're living if you're here in

**[15:57]** to where you're living if you're here in

**[15:57]** to where you're living if you're here in the US and Mr. President what you would

**[15:59]** the US and Mr. President what you would

**[15:59]** the US and Mr. President what you would like to say about the Bangladesh issue


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:01]** like to say about the Bangladesh issue

**[16:01]** like to say about the Bangladesh issue because we saw and it is evident that

**[16:03]** because we saw and it is evident that

**[16:03]** because we saw and it is evident that how the deep state of United States was

**[16:06]** how the deep state of United States was

**[16:06]** how the deep state of United States was involved to regime change during the

**[16:07]** involved to regime change during the

**[16:07]** involved to regime change during the Biden administration and then Muhammad

**[16:10]** Biden administration and then Muhammad

**[16:10]** Biden administration and then Muhammad Yulus made junior soros also. So what is

**[16:13]** Yulus made junior soros also. So what is

**[16:13]** Yulus made junior soros also. So what is your point of view about the Bangladesh

**[16:15]** your point of view about the Bangladesh

**[16:16]** your point of view about the Bangladesh and what is the role that the deep state

**[16:18]** and what is the role that the deep state

**[16:18]** and what is the role that the deep state played in in the situation? So what

**[16:20]** played in in the situation? So what

**[16:20]** played in in the situation? So what you're seeing here is uh president has

**[16:24]** you're seeing here is uh president has

**[16:24]** you're seeing here is uh president has um a translator for English to English

**[16:27]** um a translator for English to English

**[16:27]** um a translator for English to English um translation. So we thought you know

**[16:29]** um translation. So we thought you know

**[16:29]** um translation. So we thought you know maybe he can just use this transcription

**[16:32]** maybe he can just use this transcription

**[16:32]** maybe he can just use this transcription bot. So if we forward that um again so

**[16:35]** bot. So if we forward that um again so

**[16:35]** bot. So if we forward that um again so even if the audio quality isn't that

**[16:37]** even if the audio quality isn't that

**[16:37]** even if the audio quality isn't that great if there's like a lot of

**[16:38]** great if there's like a lot of

**[16:38]** great if there's like a lot of background noise the model is actually

**[16:40]** background noise the model is actually

**[16:40]** background noise the model is actually very good at kind of identifying that.

**[16:43]** very good at kind of identifying that.

**[16:43]** very good at kind of identifying that. Um yeah Bangladesh issue United States.

**[16:46]** Um yeah Bangladesh issue United States.

**[16:46]** Um yeah Bangladesh issue United States. There you go. Um so yeah so this is kind

**[16:51]** There you go. Um so yeah so this is kind

**[16:51]** There you go. Um so yeah so this is kind of the you know one component to it. So

**[16:53]** of the you know one component to it. So

**[16:53]** of the you know one component to it. So we need to um you know understand what

**[16:56]** we need to um you know understand what

**[16:56]** we need to um you know understand what the user is saying and then feed that

**[16:59]** the user is saying and then feed that

**[16:59]** the user is saying and then feed that into our LLM uh to you know have kind of


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:02]** into our LLM uh to you know have kind of

**[17:02]** into our LLM uh to you know have kind of a a meaningful conversation. So for the

**[17:05]** a a meaningful conversation. So for the

**[17:05]** a a meaningful conversation. So for the other part um you know we we don't

**[17:08]** other part um you know we we don't

**[17:08]** other part um you know we we don't specifically provide the intelligence

**[17:10]** specifically provide the intelligence

**[17:10]** specifically provide the intelligence layer. So that's where we partner with

**[17:12]** layer. So that's where we partner with

**[17:12]** layer. So that's where we partner with kind of you know the leading um model

**[17:14]** kind of you know the leading um model

**[17:14]** kind of you know the leading um model providers. You can also fine-tune your

**[17:16]** providers. You can also fine-tune your

**[17:16]** providers. You can also fine-tune your own model. um you know if you for

**[17:18]** own model. um you know if you for

**[17:18]** own model. um you know if you for example fine-tune and deploy it on say

**[17:20]** example fine-tune and deploy it on say

**[17:20]** example fine-tune and deploy it on say Google vertex AI you just need an open

**[17:22]** Google vertex AI you just need an open

**[17:22]** Google vertex AI you just need an open AI API compatible endpoint and then you

**[17:26]** AI API compatible endpoint and then you

**[17:26]** AI API compatible endpoint and then you can plug in your custom LLM into this

**[17:28]** can plug in your custom LLM into this

**[17:28]** can plug in your custom LLM into this pipeline as well um which we can look at

**[17:30]** pipeline as well um which we can look at

**[17:30]** pipeline as well um which we can look at in in a little bit and so now we have

**[17:32]** in in a little bit and so now we have

**[17:32]** in in a little bit and so now we have the other component so once the LLM

**[17:35]** the other component so once the LLM

**[17:35]** the other component so once the LLM starts streaming out the response we

**[17:38]** starts streaming out the response we

**[17:38]** starts streaming out the response we then want to start streaming the speech

**[17:41]** then want to start streaming the speech

**[17:41]** then want to start streaming the speech as soon as possible um so this pipeline

**[17:43]** as soon as possible um so this pipeline

**[17:43]** as soon as possible um so this pipeline is kind of streaming throughout so we

**[17:45]** is kind of streaming throughout so we

**[17:45]** is kind of streaming throughout so we have you know the the fastest kind of

**[17:47]** have you know the the fastest kind of

**[17:47]** have you know the the fastest kind of snappiest um response possible. So for

**[17:51]** snappiest um response possible. So for

**[17:51]** snappiest um response possible. So for you know the actual text to speech

**[17:53]** you know the actual text to speech

**[17:53]** you know the actual text to speech what's great with 11 laps you know we

**[17:55]** what's great with 11 laps you know we

**[17:55]** what's great with 11 laps you know we heard we want kind of um Brazilian

**[17:57]** heard we want kind of um Brazilian

**[17:57]** heard we want kind of um Brazilian Portuguese accent right so we have a


### [18:00 - 19:00]

**[18:00]** Portuguese accent right so we have a

**[18:00]** Portuguese accent right so we have a huge library

**[18:02]** huge library

**[18:02]** huge library um of voices that are available on the

**[18:05]** um of voices that are available on the

**[18:05]** um of voices that are available on the platform. So we actually have more than

**[18:07]** platform. So we actually have more than

**[18:07]** platform. So we actually have more than 5,000 different voices um that you can

**[18:10]** 5,000 different voices um that you can

**[18:10]** 5,000 different voices um that you can choose from. And so if you go into your

**[18:12]** choose from. And so if you go into your

**[18:12]** choose from. And so if you go into your 11 laps account, um you can go to voices

**[18:15]** 11 laps account, um you can go to voices

**[18:15]** 11 laps account, um you can go to voices and you can explore um different voices.

**[18:17]** and you can explore um different voices.

**[18:17]** and you can explore um different voices. Now if you were sitting, you know, here

**[18:19]** Now if you were sitting, you know, here

**[18:19]** Now if you were sitting, you know, here in this workshop and you were like, "Oh,

**[18:21]** in this workshop and you were like, "Oh,

**[18:21]** in this workshop and you were like, "Oh, I really like this voice." You're in

**[18:23]** I really like this voice." You're in

**[18:23]** I really like this voice." You're in luck. So you can go to the voice library

**[18:25]** luck. So you can go to the voice library

**[18:25]** luck. So you can go to the voice library and you can type in German engineer. I'm

**[18:28]** and you can type in German engineer. I'm

**[18:28]** and you can type in German engineer. I'm originally from Germany. And you find

**[18:31]** originally from Germany. And you find

**[18:31]** originally from Germany. And you find me. True success is doing what you are

**[18:35]** me. True success is doing what you are

**[18:35]** me. True success is doing what you are born to do and doing it well. Does that

**[18:38]** born to do and doing it well. Does that

**[18:38]** born to do and doing it well. Does that sound like me?

**[18:41]** sound like me?

**[18:41]** sound like me? ah okay it's it's trained on some of my

**[18:44]** ah okay it's it's trained on some of my

**[18:44]** ah okay it's it's trained on some of my uh YouTube videos so I think maybe I

**[18:47]** uh YouTube videos so I think maybe I

**[18:47]** uh YouTube videos so I think maybe I talk a bit differently um in the YouTube

**[18:49]** talk a bit differently um in the YouTube

**[18:49]** talk a bit differently um in the YouTube videos but yeah this is this is great

**[18:51]** videos but yeah this is this is great

**[18:51]** videos but yeah this is this is great and the thing is so I basically clone my

**[18:53]** and the thing is so I basically clone my

**[18:53]** and the thing is so I basically clone my voice uh and I published it on the voice

**[18:56]** voice uh and I published it on the voice

**[18:56]** voice uh and I published it on the voice library and so anytime you use that

**[18:59]** library and so anytime you use that

**[18:59]** library and so anytime you use that voice uh I get royalties um so this is a


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:02]** voice uh I get royalties um so this is a

**[19:02]** voice uh I get royalties um so this is a marketplace uh we actually uh recently

**[19:04]** marketplace uh we actually uh recently

**[19:04]** marketplace uh we actually uh recently just surpassed the $5 million US

**[19:07]** just surpassed the $5 million US

**[19:07]** just surpassed the $5 million US milestone that we paid out to um you

**[19:10]** milestone that we paid out to um you

**[19:10]** milestone that we paid out to um you know our voice actors that are kind of

**[19:12]** know our voice actors that are kind of

**[19:12]** know our voice actors that are kind of publishing their their voices on the

**[19:13]** publishing their their voices on the

**[19:13]** publishing their their voices on the platform and so you know in this

**[19:17]** platform and so you know in this

**[19:17]** platform and so you know in this workshop if you use this voice uh I'll

**[19:20]** workshop if you use this voice uh I'll

**[19:20]** workshop if you use this voice uh I'll be very grateful because then uh I can

**[19:22]** be very grateful because then uh I can

**[19:22]** be very grateful because then uh I can have a coffee later that's great um no

**[19:25]** have a coffee later that's great um no

**[19:26]** have a coffee later that's great um no but obviously you know you can use my

**[19:27]** but obviously you know you can use my

**[19:27]** but obviously you know you can use my voice if you want to you don't have to

**[19:30]** voice if you want to you don't have to

**[19:30]** voice if you want to you don't have to uh the great thing is you can set really

**[19:33]** uh the great thing is you can set really

**[19:33]** uh the great thing is you can set really kind of narrow filters to find sort of

**[19:35]** kind of narrow filters to find sort of

**[19:35]** kind of narrow filters to find sort of the voice that you know you want so for

**[19:37]** the voice that you know you want so for

**[19:37]** the voice that you know you want so for example if you want to choose choose um

**[19:40]** example if you want to choose choose um

**[19:40]** example if you want to choose choose um Portuguese.

**[19:42]** Portuguese.

**[19:42]** Portuguese. Uh you can just put the language filter

**[19:44]** Uh you can just put the language filter

**[19:44]** Uh you can just put the language filter to Portuguese and then you can choose

**[19:45]** to Portuguese and then you can choose

**[19:45]** to Portuguese and then you can choose kind of the accent. So here for example

**[19:47]** kind of the accent. So here for example

**[19:48]** kind of the accent. So here for example uh we want a Brazilian Portuguese. We

**[19:50]** uh we want a Brazilian Portuguese. We

**[19:50]** uh we want a Brazilian Portuguese. We can then further kind of narrow this

**[19:51]** can then further kind of narrow this

**[19:51]** can then further kind of narrow this down in terms of you know sort of

**[19:53]** down in terms of you know sort of

**[19:53]** down in terms of you know sort of gender, age. So there's certain meta

**[19:56]** gender, age. So there's certain meta

**[19:56]** gender, age. So there's certain meta meta taxs that we can apply. Uh and then

**[19:58]** meta taxs that we can apply. Uh and then

**[19:58]** meta taxs that we can apply. Uh and then we can see maybe here.


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:06]** Okay. I don't I don't know. I haven't

**[20:06]** Okay. I don't I don't know. I haven't spent much time in Brazil. Um

**[20:17]** Does that sound Brazilian?

**[20:17]** Does that sound Brazilian? No. Yeah. Okay. A little bit. Um, so I

**[20:21]** No. Yeah. Okay. A little bit. Um, so I

**[20:21]** No. Yeah. Okay. A little bit. Um, so I mean there's a lot of voices available

**[20:23]** mean there's a lot of voices available

**[20:23]** mean there's a lot of voices available on the platform. So you can kind of see

**[20:25]** on the platform. So you can kind of see

**[20:25]** on the platform. So you can kind of see um if you find one that that sort of

**[20:27]** um if you find one that that sort of

**[20:27]** um if you find one that that sort of fits, you know, the local accent that

**[20:29]** fits, you know, the local accent that

**[20:29]** fits, you know, the local accent that you're that you're looking for. Uh and

**[20:31]** you're that you're looking for. Uh and

**[20:31]** you're that you're looking for. Uh and then what you can do is you can um go

**[20:34]** then what you can do is you can um go

**[20:34]** then what you can do is you can um go and kind of put you know all these

**[20:35]** and kind of put you know all these

**[20:35]** and kind of put you know all these different pieces together into your

**[20:37]** different pieces together into your

**[20:37]** different pieces together into your conversational um AI agent. So here in

**[20:42]** conversational um AI agent. So here in

**[20:42]** conversational um AI agent. So here in the dashboard we can go to

**[20:43]** the dashboard we can go to

**[20:43]** the dashboard we can go to conversational AI um and we can actually

**[20:46]** conversational AI um and we can actually

**[20:46]** conversational AI um and we can actually configure a lot of our agent you know

**[20:48]** configure a lot of our agent you know

**[20:48]** configure a lot of our agent you know right there within the dashboard and

**[20:50]** right there within the dashboard and

**[20:50]** right there within the dashboard and then we can bring that into our

**[20:52]** then we can bring that into our

**[20:52]** then we can bring that into our application with um the JavaScript SDKs,

**[20:55]** application with um the JavaScript SDKs,

**[20:55]** application with um the JavaScript SDKs, the Python SDKs, kind of depending on um

**[20:57]** the Python SDKs, kind of depending on um

**[20:57]** the Python SDKs, kind of depending on um what applications you're building. Um so


### [21:00 - 22:00]

**[21:00]** what applications you're building. Um so

**[21:00]** what applications you're building. Um so we can just do a quick demo maybe of an

**[21:03]** we can just do a quick demo maybe of an

**[21:03]** we can just do a quick demo maybe of an agent that um I had built for uh a

**[21:06]** agent that um I had built for uh a

**[21:06]** agent that um I had built for uh a conference in Singapore.

**[21:08]** conference in Singapore.

**[21:08]** conference in Singapore. Um so you know if you're familiar with

**[21:11]** Um so you know if you're familiar with

**[21:11]** Um so you know if you're familiar with Singapore there is uh four official

**[21:13]** Singapore there is uh four official

**[21:14]** Singapore there is uh four official government languages. So if you're

**[21:15]** government languages. So if you're

**[21:15]** government languages. So if you're building applications you know for

**[21:17]** building applications you know for

**[21:17]** building applications you know for Singapore you actually need to you know

**[21:19]** Singapore you actually need to you know

**[21:19]** Singapore you actually need to you know provide uh English, Mandarin, Chinese,

**[21:23]** provide uh English, Mandarin, Chinese,

**[21:23]** provide uh English, Mandarin, Chinese, Malay uh and Tamil. So these are kind of

**[21:25]** Malay uh and Tamil. So these are kind of

**[21:26]** Malay uh and Tamil. So these are kind of the official government languages in

**[21:27]** the official government languages in

**[21:27]** the official government languages in Singapore. Now obviously there's other

**[21:29]** Singapore. Now obviously there's other

**[21:29]** Singapore. Now obviously there's other languages uh being spoken you know

**[21:31]** languages uh being spoken you know

**[21:31]** languages uh being spoken you know Hindi, Japanese for example um you know

**[21:35]** Hindi, Japanese for example um you know

**[21:35]** Hindi, Japanese for example um you know as well but what you can do is you can

**[21:38]** as well but what you can do is you can

**[21:38]** as well but what you can do is you can uh we so we currently have within

**[21:40]** uh we so we currently have within

**[21:40]** uh we so we currently have within conversational AI uh I think 31 um

**[21:44]** conversational AI uh I think 31 um

**[21:44]** conversational AI uh I think 31 um different languages that the agent can

**[21:46]** different languages that the agent can

**[21:46]** different languages that the agent can speak and switch between and identify.

**[21:49]** speak and switch between and identify.

**[21:49]** speak and switch between and identify. Um, we're working on the next iteration,

**[21:52]** Um, we're working on the next iteration,

**[21:52]** Um, we're working on the next iteration, so the V3 of our multilingual models,

**[21:54]** so the V3 of our multilingual models,

**[21:54]** so the V3 of our multilingual models, which will, uh, bring, I believe, up to

**[21:56]** which will, uh, bring, I believe, up to

**[21:56]** which will, uh, bring, I believe, up to 99 different languages. So, um, yeah,


### [22:00 - 23:00]

**[22:00]** 99 different languages. So, um, yeah,

**[22:00]** 99 different languages. So, um, yeah, you know, no matter where you are in the

**[22:02]** you know, no matter where you are in the

**[22:02]** you know, no matter where you are in the world, you can kind of get there pretty

**[22:04]** world, you can kind of get there pretty

**[22:04]** world, you can kind of get there pretty pretty good coverage. Um, so you can see

**[22:07]** pretty good coverage. Um, so you can see

**[22:07]** pretty good coverage. Um, so you can see here we can configure the LLM. So, we

**[22:09]** here we can configure the LLM. So, we

**[22:09]** here we can configure the LLM. So, we can, you know, choose kind of, uh, any

**[22:49]** this is kind of your standard function

**[22:49]** this is kind of your standard function calling um you know that you might be

**[22:51]** calling um you know that you might be

**[22:51]** calling um you know that you might be familiar with when you're working with

**[22:53]** familiar with when you're working with

**[22:53]** familiar with when you're working with um large language models. So depending

**[22:56]** um large language models. So depending

**[22:56]** um large language models. So depending on the model you choose as well um there

**[22:58]** on the model you choose as well um there

**[22:58]** on the model you choose as well um there might be some nuances with how reliably


### [23:00 - 24:00]

**[23:00]** might be some nuances with how reliably

**[23:00]** might be some nuances with how reliably the function calling works but you know

**[23:02]** the function calling works but you know

**[23:02]** the function calling works but you know kind of the larger ones GPT4

**[23:05]** kind of the larger ones GPT4

**[23:05]** kind of the larger ones GPT4 um plus Gemini 2.5 you know these are

**[23:09]** um plus Gemini 2.5 you know these are

**[23:09]** um plus Gemini 2.5 you know these are generally very reliable with function

**[23:11]** generally very reliable with function

**[23:11]** generally very reliable with function calling. And then we have the system

**[23:13]** calling. And then we have the system

**[23:13]** calling. And then we have the system tools that are kind of built in. So you

**[23:15]** tools that are kind of built in. So you

**[23:15]** tools that are kind of built in. So you can see here the language detection

**[23:16]** can see here the language detection

**[23:16]** can see here the language detection system tool. So we can just enable this.

**[23:19]** system tool. So we can just enable this.

**[23:19]** system tool. So we can just enable this. Um and we have this kind of you know

**[23:21]** Um and we have this kind of you know

**[23:21]** Um and we have this kind of you know configured by default to identify

**[23:24]** configured by default to identify

**[23:24]** configured by default to identify different languages and switch between

**[23:26]** different languages and switch between

**[23:26]** different languages and switch between them. Um but you can also override kind

**[23:29]** them. Um but you can also override kind

**[23:29]** them. Um but you can also override kind of the the LLM prompt to sort of

**[23:31]** of the the LLM prompt to sort of

**[23:31]** of the the LLM prompt to sort of customize that to your use case. Um and

**[23:33]** customize that to your use case. Um and

**[23:33]** customize that to your use case. Um and then maybe we can just give that a

**[23:35]** then maybe we can just give that a

**[23:35]** then maybe we can just give that a little test and see how that works. Hi

**[25:02]** guess you you get the gist. Um, so with

**[25:02]** guess you you get the gist. Um, so with the language detection tool, there's

**[25:04]** the language detection tool, there's

**[25:04]** the language detection tool, there's kind of two, you know, different modes

**[25:05]** kind of two, you know, different modes

**[25:05]** kind of two, you know, different modes with this. So, you can either, you know,

**[25:08]** with this. So, you can either, you know,

**[25:08]** with this. So, you can either, you know, as like in the first scenario with my

**[25:10]** as like in the first scenario with my

**[25:10]** as like in the first scenario with my broken Mandarin, uh, I was basically

**[25:12]** broken Mandarin, uh, I was basically

**[25:12]** broken Mandarin, uh, I was basically just saying, "Oh, sorry, I don't speak

**[25:15]** just saying, "Oh, sorry, I don't speak

**[25:15]** just saying, "Oh, sorry, I don't speak any English. Can we like speak

**[25:17]** any English. Can we like speak

**[25:17]** any English. Can we like speak Mandarin?" Um, and it would recognize,

**[25:21]** Mandarin?" Um, and it would recognize,

**[26:07]** questions we we can answer them. So there's various different ways that you

**[26:09]** there's various different ways that you

**[26:09]** there's various different ways that you can configure your agents. So you know

**[26:12]** can configure your agents. So you know

**[26:12]** can configure your agents. So you know by default you can get started in the

**[26:14]** by default you can get started in the

**[26:14]** by default you can get started in the dashboard and you can configure kind of

**[28:39]** Did anyone have questions that they

**[28:39]** Did anyone have questions that they wanted to ask in the room or I think

**[28:42]** wanted to ask in the room or I think

**[28:42]** wanted to ask in the room or I think you're you're welcome. There's like uh

**[28:44]** you're you're welcome. There's like uh

**[28:44]** you're you're welcome. There's like uh microphones. Yeah, there. Do you want to

**[28:47]** microphones. Yeah, there. Do you want to

**[28:47]** microphones. Yeah, there. Do you want to just go up to the microphone and ask? Uh

**[28:50]** just go up to the microphone and ask? Uh

**[28:50]** just go up to the microphone and ask? Uh hello everyone. First of all, great

**[28:52]** hello everyone. First of all, great

**[28:52]** hello everyone. First of all, great presentation. Uh the question is related

**[28:54]** presentation. Uh the question is related

**[28:54]** presentation. Uh the question is related to you said that it can switch to

**[28:57]** to you said that it can switch to

**[28:57]** to you said that it can switch to different languages without fine-tuning

**[28:59]** different languages without fine-tuning

**[28:59]** different languages without fine-tuning it like what is the background process


### [29:00 - 30:00]

**[29:03]** it like what is the background process

**[29:03]** it like what is the background process of it. Can you explain it bit more like

**[29:05]** of it. Can you explain it bit more like

**[29:05]** of it. Can you explain it bit more like how well it shifts so perfectly that it

**[29:08]** how well it shifts so perfectly that it

**[29:08]** how well it shifts so perfectly that it can interact in the regional languages

**[29:10]** can interact in the regional languages

**[29:10]** can interact in the regional languages as well as the accent is also similar to

**[29:13]** as well as the accent is also similar to

**[29:13]** as well as the accent is also similar to that kind of thing. Yeah. So here um

**[29:16]** that kind of thing. Yeah. So here um

**[29:16]** that kind of thing. Yeah. So here um what you can see is in in my agent

**[29:19]** what you can see is in in my agent

**[29:19]** what you can see is in in my agent configuration.

**[29:20]** configuration.

**[29:20]** configuration. So I can actually within the voices tab

**[29:24]** So I can actually within the voices tab

**[29:24]** So I can actually within the voices tab uh I can assign different voices to the

**[29:28]** uh I can assign different voices to the

**[29:28]** uh I can assign different voices to the different languages. So for example in

**[29:31]** different languages. So for example in

**[29:31]** different languages. So for example in um in in Singapore the most commonly

**[29:35]** um in in Singapore the most commonly

**[29:35]** um in in Singapore the most commonly spoken Tamil accent in Singapore is the

**[29:37]** spoken Tamil accent in Singapore is the

**[29:37]** spoken Tamil accent in Singapore is the Chennai accent Tamil. Um, and so

**[29:40]** Chennai accent Tamil. Um, and so

**[29:40]** Chennai accent Tamil. Um, and so basically I went to the voice library

**[29:42]** basically I went to the voice library

**[29:42]** basically I went to the voice library and I found a voice that is a Chennai

**[29:45]** and I found a voice that is a Chennai

**[29:45]** and I found a voice that is a Chennai accent TAML and I then basically added

**[29:48]** accent TAML and I then basically added

**[29:48]** accent TAML and I then basically added that to my voice library and just assign

**[29:50]** that to my voice library and just assign

**[29:50]** that to my voice library and just assign that here. So in the voices tab you can

**[29:53]** that here. So in the voices tab you can

**[29:53]** that here. So in the voices tab you can configure the different voices for the

**[29:55]** configure the different voices for the

**[29:55]** configure the different voices for the different languages. Um, which then

**[29:58]** different languages. Um, which then

**[29:58]** different languages. Um, which then means that you know the so the actual


### [30:00 - 31:00]

**[30:01]** means that you know the so the actual

**[30:01]** means that you know the so the actual language detection part that is the

**[30:05]** language detection part that is the

**[30:05]** language detection part that is the automatic speech recognition model. So

**[30:07]** automatic speech recognition model. So

**[30:07]** automatic speech recognition model. So the ASR model will actually identify

**[30:11]** the ASR model will actually identify

**[30:11]** the ASR model will actually identify which language you know with um so it it

**[30:14]** which language you know with um so it it

**[30:14]** which language you know with um so it it basically assigns kind of a a score like

**[30:18]** basically assigns kind of a a score like

**[30:18]** basically assigns kind of a a score like a likelihood score that this is the

**[30:20]** a likelihood score that this is the

**[30:20]** a likelihood score that this is the language that is being spoken uh as well

**[30:22]** language that is being spoken uh as well

**[30:22]** language that is being spoken uh as well as the transcript. Uh and so basically

**[30:24]** as the transcript. Uh and so basically

**[30:24]** as the transcript. Uh and so basically we use kind of with the system tool

**[30:27]** we use kind of with the system tool

**[30:27]** we use kind of with the system tool based on the the confidence score of

**[30:29]** based on the the confidence score of

**[30:30]** based on the the confidence score of this language being spoken um we then

**[30:33]** this language being spoken um we then

**[30:33]** this language being spoken um we then automatically switch to their language

**[30:35]** automatically switch to their language

**[30:35]** automatically switch to their language kind in the background uh and basically

**[30:37]** kind in the background uh and basically

**[30:37]** kind in the background uh and basically use the voice that you configured um to

**[30:40]** use the voice that you configured um to

**[30:40]** use the voice that you configured um to to reply with for this language. Does

**[30:44]** to reply with for this language. Does

**[30:44]** to reply with for this language. Does that roughly answer the question?

**[30:47]** that roughly answer the question?

**[30:47]** that roughly answer the question? Cool.

**[30:50]** Cool.

**[30:50]** Cool. Yeah. Do you mind um coming forward? So

**[30:53]** Yeah. Do you mind um coming forward? So

**[30:53]** Yeah. Do you mind um coming forward? So just uh because I think it's also being

**[30:56]** just uh because I think it's also being

**[30:56]** just uh because I think it's also being recorded then then we have it. Uh great

**[30:59]** recorded then then we have it. Uh great

**[30:59]** recorded then then we have it. Uh great presentation by the way. Uh quick


### [31:00 - 32:00]

**[31:00]** presentation by the way. Uh quick

**[31:00]** presentation by the way. Uh quick question uh other than the

**[31:05]** question uh other than the

**[31:05]** question uh other than the changing of the language or language

**[31:07]** changing of the language or language

**[31:07]** changing of the language or language detection or whatnot. Does it have any

**[31:09]** detection or whatnot. Does it have any

**[31:09]** detection or whatnot. Does it have any other ability to make any other actions

**[31:11]** other ability to make any other actions

**[31:11]** other ability to make any other actions throughout the call? For example,

**[31:13]** throughout the call? For example,

**[31:14]** throughout the call? For example, use case appointment setting. Mhm. Does

**[31:16]** use case appointment setting. Mhm. Does

**[31:16]** use case appointment setting. Mhm. Does it have actions to maybe call a web hook

**[31:18]** it have actions to maybe call a web hook

**[31:18]** it have actions to maybe call a web hook and to to to take a look to see if

**[31:20]** and to to to take a look to see if

**[31:20]** and to to to take a look to see if there's any appointments available

**[31:21]** there's any appointments available

**[31:21]** there's any appointments available either in make or n and then report back

**[31:24]** either in make or n and then report back

**[31:24]** either in make or n and then report back like we can have that in the the

**[31:26]** like we can have that in the the

**[31:26]** like we can have that in the the prompts. Yeah, correct. So the basically

**[31:29]** prompts. Yeah, correct. So the basically

**[31:30]** prompts. Yeah, correct. So the basically the configuration of that is a um

**[31:32]** the configuration of that is a um

**[31:32]** the configuration of that is a um combination of your system prompt

**[31:35]** combination of your system prompt

**[31:35]** combination of your system prompt together with the tools. So you can

**[31:39]** together with the tools. So you can

**[31:40]** together with the tools. So you can configure um custom tools and so these

**[31:44]** configure um custom tools and so these

**[31:44]** configure um custom tools and so these can be serverside tools which then would

**[31:46]** can be serverside tools which then would

**[31:46]** can be serverside tools which then would be a web hook call um you know to your

**[31:49]** be a web hook call um you know to your

**[31:49]** be a web hook call um you know to your CRM to your system. Um so this is you

**[31:52]** CRM to your system. Um so this is you

**[31:52]** CRM to your system. Um so this is you know the the the standard kind of tool

**[31:55]** know the the the standard kind of tool

**[31:55]** know the the the standard kind of tool calling function calling um that the LLM

**[31:58]** calling function calling um that the LLM

**[31:58]** calling function calling um that the LLM supports. Um, so you you know like GPT40


### [32:00 - 33:00]

**[32:02]** supports. Um, so you you know like GPT40

**[32:02]** supports. Um, so you you know like GPT40 or like the the the more modern models

**[32:05]** or like the the the more modern models

**[32:05]** or like the the the more modern models generally support function calling and

**[32:07]** generally support function calling and

**[32:07]** generally support function calling and structured outputs. Um, and so as long

**[32:10]** structured outputs. Um, and so as long

**[32:10]** structured outputs. Um, and so as long as the large language model that you're

**[32:12]** as the large language model that you're

**[32:12]** as the large language model that you're using to power your agent supports

**[32:14]** using to power your agent supports

**[32:14]** using to power your agent supports function calling um you can add your

**[32:18]** function calling um you can add your

**[32:18]** function calling um you can add your tools and and this can be combination of

**[32:20]** tools and and this can be combination of

**[32:20]** tools and and this can be combination of server side tools. Um so for example you

**[32:23]** server side tools. Um so for example you

**[32:23]** server side tools. Um so for example you know as you mentioned like the

**[32:24]** know as you mentioned like the

**[32:24]** know as you mentioned like the scheduling um you can put in uh so for

**[32:27]** scheduling um you can put in uh so for

**[32:27]** scheduling um you can put in uh so for example we we also have an example with

**[32:30]** example we we also have an example with

**[32:30]** example we we also have an example with cal.com

**[32:31]** cal.com

**[32:32]** cal.com uh you can put in the API endpoints for

**[32:35]** uh you can put in the API endpoints for

**[32:35]** uh you can put in the API endpoints for um cal.com and then the agent can

**[32:37]** um cal.com and then the agent can

**[32:37]** um cal.com and then the agent can actually look up oh okay is there

**[32:39]** actually look up oh okay is there

**[32:39]** actually look up oh okay is there availability in the calendar and it can

**[32:42]** availability in the calendar and it can

**[32:42]** availability in the calendar and it can schedule um so it can ask for like the

**[32:45]** schedule um so it can ask for like the

**[32:45]** schedule um so it can ask for like the the email address and then it it can

**[32:48]** the email address and then it it can

**[32:48]** the email address and then it it can schedule you know the the the ing for

**[32:51]** schedule you know the the the ing for

**[32:51]** schedule you know the the the ing for all the parties kind of through the

**[32:53]** all the parties kind of through the

**[32:53]** all the parties kind of through the conversational AI agent. Okay, one more

**[32:56]** conversational AI agent. Okay, one more

**[32:56]** conversational AI agent. Okay, one more question. Uh what would you suggest uh

**[32:59]** question. Uh what would you suggest uh

**[32:59]** question. Uh what would you suggest uh would be a


### [33:00 - 34:00]

**[33:01]** would be a

**[33:01]** would be a a good structure for a conversational

**[33:04]** a good structure for a conversational

**[33:04]** a good structure for a conversational agent that has like super low latency?

**[33:06]** agent that has like super low latency?

**[33:06]** agent that has like super low latency? Obviously the model plays a big role. So

**[33:09]** Obviously the model plays a big role. So

**[33:09]** Obviously the model plays a big role. So obviously like price and model or like

**[33:11]** obviously like price and model or like

**[33:11]** obviously like price and model or like two like price and the latency are like

**[33:13]** two like price and the latency are like

**[33:13]** two like price and the latency are like the two biggest key factors when we want

**[33:15]** the two biggest key factors when we want

**[33:15]** the two biggest key factors when we want to do like a outbound or inbound dialing

**[33:17]** to do like a outbound or inbound dialing

**[33:17]** to do like a outbound or inbound dialing agent. What would you suggest for let's

**[33:21]** agent. What would you suggest for let's

**[33:21]** agent. What would you suggest for let's say an outbound dialing agent or even an

**[33:23]** say an outbound dialing agent or even an

**[33:23]** say an outbound dialing agent or even an inbound to decrease the latency to make

**[33:25]** inbound to decrease the latency to make

**[33:25]** inbound to decrease the latency to make it seem more like conversational like

**[33:28]** it seem more like conversational like

**[33:28]** it seem more like conversational like because obviously if you use a really

**[33:30]** because obviously if you use a really

**[33:30]** because obviously if you use a really good model it's really large the latency

**[33:33]** good model it's really large the latency

**[33:33]** good model it's really large the latency is just super high and it just doesn't

**[33:35]** is just super high and it just doesn't

**[33:35]** is just super high and it just doesn't really that that's not a meaningful

**[33:37]** really that that's not a meaningful

**[33:37]** really that that's not a meaningful conversation to have. Gotcha. Um I think

**[33:41]** conversation to have. Gotcha. Um I think

**[33:41]** conversation to have. Gotcha. Um I think that's a good question. And I think we

**[33:42]** that's a good question. And I think we

**[33:42]** that's a good question. And I think we have some so if you go to the

**[33:44]** have some so if you go to the

**[33:44]** have some so if you go to the documentation

**[33:46]** documentation

**[33:46]** documentation um within the conversational AI we have

**[33:49]** um within the conversational AI we have

**[33:49]** um within the conversational AI we have some um kind of best practices. I'm not

**[33:53]** some um kind of best practices. I'm not

**[33:53]** some um kind of best practices. I'm not sure if we have like specific

**[33:58]** sure if we have like specific

**[33:58]** sure if we have like specific I do that by testing but I want to skip


### [34:00 - 35:00]

**[34:01]** I do that by testing but I want to skip

**[34:01]** I do that by testing but I want to skip the testing part. Yeah. Do we have

**[34:03]** the testing part. Yeah. Do we have

**[34:03]** the testing part. Yeah. Do we have specific guidance on like the best

**[34:06]** specific guidance on like the best

**[34:06]** specific guidance on like the best model? It kind of depends on your use

**[34:07]** model? It kind of depends on your use

**[34:07]** model? It kind of depends on your use case, right?

**[34:17]** Yeah. Um

**[34:17]** Yeah. Um although I think it's like he's asking

**[34:19]** although I think it's like he's asking

**[34:19]** although I think it's like he's asking about like the best LLM to use right for

**[34:22]** about like the best LLM to use right for

**[34:22]** about like the best LLM to use right for right. Um

**[34:24]** right. Um

**[34:24]** right. Um yeah, I think it depends on your use

**[34:26]** yeah, I think it depends on your use

**[34:26]** yeah, I think it depends on your use case like you know depending on kind of

**[34:29]** case like you know depending on kind of

**[34:29]** case like you know depending on kind of the function calling and you know how

**[34:31]** the function calling and you know how

**[34:31]** the function calling and you know how much of that you have. You can probably

**[34:33]** much of that you have. You can probably

**[34:33]** much of that you have. You can probably go down to like yeah a Gemini flash or

**[34:37]** go down to like yeah a Gemini flash or

**[34:37]** go down to like yeah a Gemini flash or flashlight

**[34:39]** flashlight

**[34:39]** flashlight um to like reduce the latency in terms

**[34:41]** um to like reduce the latency in terms

**[34:42]** um to like reduce the latency in terms of um of that. But I think on our end in

**[34:46]** of um of that. But I think on our end in

**[34:46]** of um of that. But I think on our end in terms of like the voice models, so we

**[34:49]** terms of like the voice models, so we

**[34:49]** terms of like the voice models, so we use um where are the

**[34:53]** use um where are the

**[34:53]** use um where are the yeah we use by default kind of the flash

**[34:56]** yeah we use by default kind of the flash

**[34:56]** yeah we use by default kind of the flash models for the speech generation. Um so


### [35:00 - 36:00]

**[35:00]** models for the speech generation. Um so

**[35:00]** models for the speech generation. Um so depending on the languages that you want

**[35:02]** depending on the languages that you want

**[35:02]** depending on the languages that you want to support um

**[35:05]** to support um

**[35:05]** to support um yeah it's just a test. I I think testing

**[35:07]** yeah it's just a test. I I think testing

**[35:07]** yeah it's just a test. I I think testing would I think I'll be able to figure out

**[35:09]** would I think I'll be able to figure out

**[35:09]** would I think I'll be able to figure out with like proper testing with different

**[35:11]** with like proper testing with different

**[35:11]** with like proper testing with different models flash on off all that good stuff.

**[35:13]** models flash on off all that good stuff.

**[35:13]** models flash on off all that good stuff. Thank you so much, man. Cool. Thanks.

**[35:24]** I have a couple of questions. So, number

**[35:24]** I have a couple of questions. So, number one, what's the total cost per minute

**[35:26]** one, what's the total cost per minute

**[35:26]** one, what's the total cost per minute coming down to?

**[35:28]** coming down to?

**[35:28]** coming down to? You mean

**[35:30]** You mean

**[35:30]** You mean like by default? So, it kind of depends

**[35:33]** like by default? So, it kind of depends

**[35:33]** like by default? So, it kind of depends what um pricing tier you're on. Uh so if

**[35:37]** what um pricing tier you're on. Uh so if

**[35:37]** what um pricing tier you're on. Uh so if you

**[35:39]** you

**[35:39]** you go to the pricing page

**[35:42]** go to the pricing page

**[35:42]** go to the pricing page uh so here conversational AI so

**[35:46]** uh so here conversational AI so

**[35:46]** uh so here conversational AI so depending on kind of the the tier you on

**[35:49]** depending on kind of the the tier you on

**[35:49]** depending on kind of the the tier you on um the you know there's a certain amount

**[35:52]** um the you know there's a certain amount

**[35:52]** um the you know there's a certain amount of minutes that are included. So

**[35:54]** of minutes that are included. So

**[35:54]** of minutes that are included. So currently the pricing is based on call

**[35:57]** currently the pricing is based on call

**[35:57]** currently the pricing is based on call minutes.

**[35:59]** minutes.

**[35:59]** minutes. Um and then depending on which tier


### [36:00 - 37:00]

**[36:01]** Um and then depending on which tier

**[36:01]** Um and then depending on which tier you're on, there is additional minutes

**[36:05]** you're on, there is additional minutes

**[36:05]** you're on, there is additional minutes that are charged um at a specific price.

**[36:09]** that are charged um at a specific price.

**[36:09]** that are charged um at a specific price. So it does somewhat depend on um

**[36:15]** So it does somewhat depend on um

**[36:15]** So it does somewhat depend on um kind of the the pricing tier that you're

**[36:18]** kind of the the pricing tier that you're

**[36:18]** kind of the the pricing tier that you're that you're on. If you want to have like

**[36:21]** that you're on. If you want to have like

**[36:22]** that you're on. If you want to have like an application where you need like

**[36:24]** an application where you need like

**[36:24]** an application where you need like really long interaction times, say you

**[36:26]** really long interaction times, say you

**[36:26]** really long interaction times, say you want to do a companion that will

**[36:29]** want to do a companion that will

**[36:29]** want to do a companion that will talk to you while you cook, is there

**[36:32]** talk to you while you cook, is there

**[36:32]** talk to you while you cook, is there something you can do to mitigate that

**[36:34]** something you can do to mitigate that

**[36:34]** something you can do to mitigate that that cost? The timing cost. Yeah, that's

**[36:37]** that cost? The timing cost. Yeah, that's

**[36:37]** that cost? The timing cost. Yeah, that's a good question. And I think like for

**[36:39]** a good question. And I think like for

**[36:39]** a good question. And I think like for those use cases it might not be um great

**[36:42]** those use cases it might not be um great

**[36:42]** those use cases it might not be um great at the moment because like if they are

**[36:44]** at the moment because like if they are

**[36:44]** at the moment because like if they are just running this like 24/7 to like be

**[36:48]** just running this like 24/7 to like be

**[36:48]** just running this like 24/7 to like be able to talk to someone um the cost is

**[36:51]** able to talk to someone um the cost is

**[36:51]** able to talk to someone um the cost is is pretty significant. Um

**[36:55]** is pretty significant. Um

**[36:55]** is pretty significant. Um that's a good question. I think we I

**[36:57]** that's a good question. I think we I

**[36:57]** that's a good question. I think we I mean there's potentially like if if you

**[36:59]** mean there's potentially like if if you

**[36:59]** mean there's potentially like if if you reach out to the sales team um there is


### [37:00 - 38:00]

**[37:02]** reach out to the sales team um there is

**[37:02]** reach out to the sales team um there is some like custom pricing that we can do

**[37:05]** some like custom pricing that we can do

**[37:05]** some like custom pricing that we can do based on the use case. Um but I think

**[37:07]** based on the use case. Um but I think

**[37:07]** based on the use case. Um but I think for now this is charged based on minutes

**[37:11]** for now this is charged based on minutes

**[37:11]** for now this is charged based on minutes used like the that the session the

**[37:14]** used like the that the session the

**[37:14]** used like the that the session the session is live. Okay. And final

**[37:16]** session is live. Okay. And final

**[37:16]** session is live. Okay. And final question um I tried to do an agent in

**[37:19]** question um I tried to do an agent in

**[37:19]** question um I tried to do an agent in your dashboard and it it had several

**[37:21]** your dashboard and it it had several

**[37:21]** your dashboard and it it had several tasks. So it was one onboarding task

**[37:24]** tasks. So it was one onboarding task

**[37:24]** tasks. So it was one onboarding task then one another followup task and it

**[37:28]** then one another followup task and it

**[37:28]** then one another followup task and it kind of got confused like it was not

**[37:30]** kind of got confused like it was not

**[37:30]** kind of got confused like it was not like identifying when to do one task

**[37:32]** like identifying when to do one task

**[37:32]** like identifying when to do one task when to do the other. So is there a way

**[37:35]** when to do the other. So is there a way

**[37:35]** when to do the other. So is there a way to mitigate this or maybe have a multi-

**[37:38]** to mitigate this or maybe have a multi-

**[37:38]** to mitigate this or maybe have a multi- agent configuration? Yeah, so there's um

**[37:42]** agent configuration? Yeah, so there's um

**[37:42]** agent configuration? Yeah, so there's um we have what we call uh agent to agent

**[37:46]** we have what we call uh agent to agent

**[37:46]** we have what we call uh agent to agent uh agent to agent transfers. Um so one

**[37:50]** uh agent to agent transfers. Um so one

**[37:50]** uh agent to agent transfers. Um so one way to do this is to um you know

**[37:52]** way to do this is to um you know

**[37:52]** way to do this is to um you know basically set this up um and so this is

**[37:55]** basically set this up um and so this is

**[37:56]** basically set this up um and so this is this is a system tool as well um where

**[37:59]** this is a system tool as well um where

**[37:59]** this is a system tool as well um where you basically set up different agents


### [38:00 - 39:00]

**[38:01]** you basically set up different agents

**[38:01]** you basically set up different agents for different use cases. So like certain

**[38:03]** for different use cases. So like certain

**[38:03]** for different use cases. So like certain use cases you also might use want to use

**[38:05]** use cases you also might use want to use

**[38:05]** use cases you also might use want to use a different LLM to power that use case

**[38:09]** a different LLM to power that use case

**[38:09]** a different LLM to power that use case kind of you know depending on um which

**[38:12]** kind of you know depending on um which

**[38:12]** kind of you know depending on um which LLM is sort of best for the task. Uh and

**[38:15]** LLM is sort of best for the task. Uh and

**[38:15]** LLM is sort of best for the task. Uh and then you can configure different agents

**[38:17]** then you can configure different agents

**[38:17]** then you can configure different agents for different tasks. Uh and then you can

**[38:21]** for different tasks. Uh and then you can

**[38:21]** for different tasks. Uh and then you can configure kind of an orchestration uh

**[38:23]** configure kind of an orchestration uh

**[38:23]** configure kind of an orchestration uh setup that basically will then route

**[38:26]** setup that basically will then route

**[38:26]** setup that basically will then route kind of in the background to a different

**[38:28]** kind of in the background to a different

**[38:28]** kind of in the background to a different agent. Um, if you keep the voice the

**[38:31]** agent. Um, if you keep the voice the

**[38:31]** agent. Um, if you keep the voice the same, this actually happens somewhat

**[38:33]** same, this actually happens somewhat

**[38:33]** same, this actually happens somewhat like silently without the user actually

**[38:35]** like silently without the user actually

**[38:35]** like silently without the user actually knowing that they're being transferred.

**[38:37]** knowing that they're being transferred.

**[38:37]** knowing that they're being transferred. So, it's not like it's an immediate

**[38:39]** So, it's not like it's an immediate

**[38:39]** So, it's not like it's an immediate transfer. Uh, it just means that you

**[38:41]** transfer. Uh, it just means that you

**[38:41]** transfer. Uh, it just means that you can, you know, sort of develop these

**[38:44]** can, you know, sort of develop these

**[38:44]** can, you know, sort of develop these agents um potentially also across teams

**[38:47]** agents um potentially also across teams

**[38:47]** agents um potentially also across teams where you have, you know, one team that

**[38:49]** where you have, you know, one team that

**[38:49]** where you have, you know, one team that owns kind of this specific agent uh and

**[38:51]** owns kind of this specific agent uh and

**[38:52]** owns kind of this specific agent uh and then in the background you just kind of

**[38:53]** then in the background you just kind of

**[38:53]** then in the background you just kind of switch between the agents um for like

**[38:57]** switch between the agents um for like

**[38:57]** switch between the agents um for like the different tasks. Great. Thank you.


### [39:00 - 40:00]

**[39:00]** the different tasks. Great. Thank you.

**[39:00]** the different tasks. Great. Thank you. Thanks.

**[39:06]** Cool. Any more questions?

**[39:06]** Cool. Any more questions? Yeah. Um, latency. So, in general, like

**[39:10]** Yeah. Um, latency. So, in general, like

**[39:10]** Yeah. Um, latency. So, in general, like simple examples usually, you know, great

**[39:13]** simple examples usually, you know, great

**[39:13]** simple examples usually, you know, great for demos, but when you have something

**[39:16]** for demos, but when you have something

**[39:16]** for demos, but when you have something more heavy, more enterprise grade, and

**[39:19]** more heavy, more enterprise grade, and

**[39:20]** more heavy, more enterprise grade, and you have more data, more, you know, your

**[39:22]** you have more data, more, you know, your

**[39:22]** you have more data, more, you know, your rags taking time to come back. um how do

**[39:27]** rags taking time to come back. um how do

**[39:27]** rags taking time to come back. um how do you not have a shitty experience because

**[39:30]** you not have a shitty experience because

**[39:30]** you not have a shitty experience because you think of it from the end users

**[39:33]** you think of it from the end users

**[39:33]** you think of it from the end users perspective right they're like uh like

**[39:36]** perspective right they're like uh like

**[39:36]** perspective right they're like uh like and then blank for the next minute or

**[39:38]** and then blank for the next minute or

**[39:38]** and then blank for the next minute or two um do you suggest fillers like you

**[39:43]** two um do you suggest fillers like you

**[39:43]** two um do you suggest fillers like you know does the conversational AI say I'm

**[39:47]** know does the conversational AI say I'm

**[39:47]** know does the conversational AI say I'm thinking let me think about it or h how

**[39:50]** thinking let me think about it or h how

**[39:50]** thinking let me think about it or h how do you kind of make it more natural

**[39:52]** do you kind of make it more natural

**[39:52]** do you kind of make it more natural because there is going to be like in an

**[39:54]** because there is going to be like in an

**[39:54]** because there is going to be like in an enterprise setup right like if I have to

**[39:56]** enterprise setup right like if I have to

**[39:56]** enterprise setup right like if I have to then go look up a patient's claim, you


### [40:00 - 41:00]

**[40:00]** then go look up a patient's claim, you

**[40:00]** then go look up a patient's claim, you know, that might go hit a database. Once

**[40:03]** know, that might go hit a database. Once

**[40:03]** know, that might go hit a database. Once that comes back, it goes to other

**[40:04]** that comes back, it goes to other

**[40:04]** that comes back, it goes to other systems, does a whole bunch of things,

**[40:07]** systems, does a whole bunch of things,

**[40:07]** systems, does a whole bunch of things, but it takes time, right? Like uh h how

**[40:10]** but it takes time, right? Like uh h how

**[40:10]** but it takes time, right? Like uh h how do you set it up so that you know

**[40:14]** do you set it up so that you know

**[40:14]** do you set it up so that you know latency that can't be avoided? How do we

**[40:16]** latency that can't be avoided? How do we

**[40:16]** latency that can't be avoided? How do we make the conversational experience

**[40:19]** make the conversational experience

**[40:19]** make the conversational experience better? Yeah. So there's there's certain

**[40:22]** better? Yeah. So there's there's certain

**[40:22]** better? Yeah. So there's there's certain things that you can do. So you know

**[40:25]** things that you can do. So you know

**[40:25]** things that you can do. So you know generally kind of these are you know if

**[40:28]** generally kind of these are you know if

**[40:28]** generally kind of these are you know if you have like a big knowledge base for

**[40:30]** you have like a big knowledge base for

**[40:30]** you have like a big knowledge base for example like using rack is kind of one

**[40:32]** example like using rack is kind of one

**[40:32]** example like using rack is kind of one um way of kind of mitigating you know

**[40:35]** um way of kind of mitigating you know

**[40:35]** um way of kind of mitigating you know that taking too much time. Um and then

**[40:38]** that taking too much time. Um and then

**[40:38]** that taking too much time. Um and then also in terms of your tools um when you

**[40:41]** also in terms of your tools um when you

**[40:41]** also in terms of your tools um when you define your tools you can um configure

**[40:46]** define your tools you can um configure

**[40:46]** define your tools you can um configure the

**[40:48]** the

**[40:48]** the where is it kind of the response time.

**[40:50]** where is it kind of the response time.

**[40:50]** where is it kind of the response time. So when you you know add parameters

**[40:53]** So when you you know add parameters

**[40:53]** So when you you know add parameters um where was the configuration

**[40:56]** um where was the configuration

**[40:56]** um where was the configuration I think there's a configuration for yeah

**[40:59]** I think there's a configuration for yeah

**[40:59]** I think there's a configuration for yeah like the timeout um so basically how


### [41:00 - 42:00]

**[41:02]** like the timeout um so basically how

**[41:02]** like the timeout um so basically how long you want to wait um for you know

**[41:06]** long you want to wait um for you know

**[41:06]** long you want to wait um for you know this tool to sort of come back um and

**[41:09]** this tool to sort of come back um and

**[41:09]** this tool to sort of come back um and also if you want to wait sort of for the

**[41:11]** also if you want to wait sort of for the

**[41:11]** also if you want to wait sort of for the response. Um, so I think the maximum

**[41:14]** response. Um, so I think the maximum

**[41:14]** response. Um, so I think the maximum time out we allow is like 120 seconds.

**[41:17]** time out we allow is like 120 seconds.

**[41:17]** time out we allow is like 120 seconds. Um, and then

**[41:19]** Um, and then

**[41:19]** Um, and then the the agent will actually like say,

**[41:22]** the the agent will actually like say,

**[41:22]** the the agent will actually like say, "Oh, I'm I'm currently looking that up

**[41:24]** "Oh, I'm I'm currently looking that up

**[41:24]** "Oh, I'm I'm currently looking that up in the system. Uh, sorry, you know,

**[41:26]** in the system. Uh, sorry, you know,

**[41:26]** in the system. Uh, sorry, you know, we're still waiting kind of on the

**[41:28]** we're still waiting kind of on the

**[41:28]** we're still waiting kind of on the response." Um, so that is sort of built

**[41:31]** response." Um, so that is sort of built

**[41:31]** response." Um, so that is sort of built into the tooling here. Now, you know,

**[41:33]** into the tooling here. Now, you know,

**[41:33]** into the tooling here. Now, you know, depending on your Yeah.

**[41:38]** depending on your Yeah.

**[41:38]** depending on your Yeah. like use case, you probably want to to

**[41:40]** like use case, you probably want to to

**[41:40]** like use case, you probably want to to to put that kind of, you know, fairly

**[41:43]** to put that kind of, you know, fairly

**[41:43]** to put that kind of, you know, fairly low because like yeah, if you're waiting

**[41:45]** low because like yeah, if you're waiting

**[41:45]** low because like yeah, if you're waiting on the call,

**[41:48]** on the call,

**[41:48]** on the call, I wonder if you can do something where

**[41:49]** I wonder if you can do something where

**[41:49]** I wonder if you can do something where it's like um oh, I I'll call you back,

**[41:53]** it's like um oh, I I'll call you back,

**[41:53]** it's like um oh, I I'll call you back, you know, like I I'll take that back and

**[41:55]** you know, like I I'll take that back and

**[41:55]** you know, like I I'll take that back and like take the action or but I think for

**[41:57]** like take the action or but I think for

**[41:57]** like take the action or but I think for now it would just yeah, depending on

**[41:59]** now it would just yeah, depending on

**[41:59]** now it would just yeah, depending on your timeout time. Okay, it basically


### [42:00 - 43:00]

**[42:01]** your timeout time. Okay, it basically

**[42:01]** your timeout time. Okay, it basically will wait for the response and it will

**[42:04]** will wait for the response and it will

**[42:04]** will wait for the response and it will tell like it will stay conversational to

**[42:07]** tell like it will stay conversational to

**[42:07]** tell like it will stay conversational to like you know talk the user through that

**[42:09]** like you know talk the user through that

**[42:09]** like you know talk the user through that oh we're still waiting on on the tool

**[42:11]** oh we're still waiting on on the tool

**[42:11]** oh we're still waiting on on the tool response um there and are all

**[42:15]** response um there and are all

**[42:15]** response um there and are all conversations linear or can they branch

**[42:19]** conversations linear or can they branch

**[42:19]** conversations linear or can they branch off come back like while it's looking up

**[42:21]** off come back like while it's looking up

**[42:21]** off come back like while it's looking up something can it come back in 5 minutes

**[42:24]** something can it come back in 5 minutes

**[42:24]** something can it come back in 5 minutes later oh you know I found you know in

**[42:26]** later oh you know I found you know in

**[42:26]** later oh you know I found you know in the meantime they get other details from

**[42:28]** the meantime they get other details from

**[42:28]** the meantime they get other details from the customer or patient or um

**[42:34]** the customer or patient or um

**[42:34]** the customer or patient or um no I that's a good question. I don't

**[42:51]** into a queue. Um the only thing then is

**[42:51]** into a queue. Um the only thing then is like how do you update the agent?

**[42:56]** like how do you update the agent?

**[42:56]** like how do you update the agent? I think like if you're using the I I

**[42:58]** I think like if you're using the I I

**[42:58]** I think like if you're using the I I would need to kind of look this up.


### [43:00 - 44:00]

**[47:41]** case it does better because it can Yeah,

**[47:42]** case it does better because it can Yeah, it does. You know, it doesn't go through

**[47:43]** it does. You know, it doesn't go through

**[47:43]** it does. You know, it doesn't go through text. Yeah, it does. Sometimes it like

**[47:46]** text. Yeah, it does. Sometimes it like

**[47:46]** text. Yeah, it does. Sometimes it like switches the accents too, which is kind

**[47:48]** switches the accents too, which is kind

**[48:09]** some we have a customer in India,

**[48:09]** some we have a customer in India, Supernova, that does, but it's

**[48:12]** Supernova, that does, but it's

**[48:12]** Supernova, that does, but it's specifically English learning for um the

**[48:16]** specifically English learning for um the

**[48:16]** specifically English learning for um the Indian market. Um, so I think it's a bit

**[48:19]** Indian market. Um, so I think it's a bit

**[48:19]** Indian market. Um, so I think it's a bit of a different use case there. Do you

**[48:22]** of a different use case there. Do you

**[48:22]** of a different use case there. Do you know if it produces English in a

**[48:25]** know if it produces English in a

**[48:26]** know if it produces English in a particular accent or is it like using

**[49:10]** fraudsters using these tools.

**[49:10]** fraudsters using these tools. Yeah, so there's definitely you know a

**[49:13]** Yeah, so there's definitely you know a

**[49:13]** Yeah, so there's definitely you know a worry with that like obviously kind of

**[49:15]** worry with that like obviously kind of

**[49:15]** worry with that like obviously kind of all this this technology. So, one thing

**[49:18]** all this this technology. So, one thing

**[49:18]** all this this technology. So, one thing that is kind of very important for us,

**[49:21]** that is kind of very important for us,

**[49:21]** that is kind of very important for us, so you can if you go to

**[49:22]** so you can if you go to

**[49:22]** so you can if you go to 11laps.io/safety,

**[49:24]** 11laps.io/safety,

**[49:24]** 11laps.io/safety, uh you can see kind of the safety tools

**[49:26]** uh you can see kind of the safety tools

**[49:26]** uh you can see kind of the safety tools that we're developing um you know uh in

**[49:29]** that we're developing um you know uh in

**[49:29]** that we're developing um you know uh in parallel to to our um features. So

**[49:33]** parallel to to our um features. So

**[49:33]** parallel to to our um features. So there's a there's a bunch of things that

**[49:34]** there's a there's a bunch of things that

**[49:34]** there's a there's a bunch of things that we do um like specifically you know we

**[49:38]** we do um like specifically you know we

**[49:38]** we do um like specifically you know we do like life moderation for certain

**[49:40]** do like life moderation for certain

**[49:40]** do like life moderation for certain things. So actually when you publish

**[49:43]** things. So actually when you publish

**[49:43]** things. So actually when you publish your voice to the voice library you can

**[49:47]** your voice to the voice library you can

**[49:47]** your voice to the voice library you can specify um terms that you don't want

**[49:50]** specify um terms that you don't want

**[49:50]** specify um terms that you don't want your voice to say. Uh and then in this

**[49:53]** your voice to say. Uh and then in this

**[49:53]** your voice to say. Uh and then in this case we actually have life moderation

**[49:56]** case we actually have life moderation

**[49:56]** case we actually have life moderation where um we will make sure that your

**[49:59]** where um we will make sure that your

**[49:59]** where um we will make sure that your voice isn't used to generate kind of


### [50:00 - 51:00]

**[50:00]** voice isn't used to generate kind of

**[50:00]** voice isn't used to generate kind of specific terms or um sentences.

**[50:04]** specific terms or um sentences.

**[50:04]** specific terms or um sentences. Um we also kind of monitor in general uh

**[51:03]** the voice capture um that we developed

**[51:03]** the voice capture um that we developed when you are creating a um a

**[51:06]** when you are creating a um a

**[51:06]** when you are creating a um a professional voice clone.

**[51:09]** professional voice clone.

**[51:09]** professional voice clone. Uh we actually generate kind of a random

**[51:12]** Uh we actually generate kind of a random

**[51:12]** Uh we actually generate kind of a random sentence that you need to read out to

**[51:37]** but yeah there is obviously always a concern that your technology is being

**[51:39]** concern that your technology is being

**[51:39]** concern that your technology is being used for fraudulent activity but I think

**[51:42]** used for fraudulent activity but I think

**[51:42]** used for fraudulent activity but I think so far um you know we've been trying to

**[51:46]** so far um you know we've been trying to

**[51:46]** so far um you know we've been trying to mitigate that with like the safety

**[51:47]** mitigate that with like the safety

**[51:47]** mitigate that with like the safety tooling. Definitely. Yeah. Looks like a

**[51:49]** tooling. Definitely. Yeah. Looks like a

**[51:49]** tooling. Definitely. Yeah. Looks like a lot of good guardrails in place. Thanks.

**[52:37]** English, they kind of jump back to, you

**[52:37]** English, they kind of jump back to, you know, the the language that they are

**[52:39]** know, the the language that they are

**[52:39]** know, the the language that they are most comfortable. Sometimes they jump

**[52:41]** most comfortable. Sometimes they jump

**[52:41]** most comfortable. Sometimes they jump around different languages. Uh

**[52:45]** around different languages. Uh

**[52:45]** around different languages. Uh how would because like the way you

**[52:48]** how would because like the way you

**[52:48]** how would because like the way you explained it, it kind of you have some

**[52:50]** explained it, it kind of you have some

**[52:50]** explained it, it kind of you have some kind of a router that checks what kind

**[52:53]** kind of a router that checks what kind

**[52:59]** off. But within a conversation they they kind of jump between like you know


### [53:00 - 54:00]

**[53:00]** kind of jump between like you know

**[53:00]** kind of jump between like you know they'll explain a few things and then

**[53:02]** they'll explain a few things and then

**[53:02]** they'll explain a few things and then they'll go few words with a very you

**[53:05]** they'll go few words with a very you

**[53:19]** back hey you know this this you know I

**[53:20]** back hey you know this this you know I took this medication it hurts you know

**[53:22]** took this medication it hurts you know

**[53:22]** took this medication it hurts you know and then if you say okay where is it

**[53:24]** and then if you say okay where is it

**[53:24]** and then if you say okay where is it hurting? house. Then they suddenly kind

**[53:27]** hurting? house. Then they suddenly kind

**[53:27]** hurting? house. Then they suddenly kind of you know they re regress to whatever

**[53:29]** of you know they re regress to whatever

**[53:29]** of you know they re regress to whatever language is most comfortable to them to

**[53:33]** language is most comfortable to them to

**[53:33]** language is most comfortable to them to explain their thing.

**[53:36]** explain their thing.

**[53:36]** explain their thing. Gotcha. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can see

**[53:39]** Gotcha. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can see

**[53:39]** Gotcha. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can see here that like the transcript it

**[53:41]** here that like the transcript it

**[53:41]** here that like the transcript it actually correctly identified, you know,

**[53:43]** actually correctly identified, you know,

**[53:43]** actually correctly identified, you know, shardan freder um because technically

**[53:46]** shardan freder um because technically

**[53:46]** shardan freder um because technically it's also an English word, right? But

**[53:48]** it's also an English word, right? But

**[53:48]** it's also an English word, right? But then like on the on the Chinese word it

**[53:51]** then like on the on the Chinese word it

**[53:51]** then like on the on the Chinese word it just completely you know well you know

**[53:54]** just completely you know well you know

**[53:54]** just completely you know well you know you can blame partly my pronunciation

**[53:58]** you can blame partly my pronunciation

**[53:58]** you can blame partly my pronunciation probably you can blame it a lot but um


### [54:00 - 55:00]

**[54:01]** probably you can blame it a lot but um

**[54:01]** probably you can blame it a lot but um yeah I wonder if like

**[54:04]** yeah I wonder if like

**[54:04]** yeah I wonder if like a native speaker

**[54:07]** a native speaker

**[54:07]** a native speaker yeah I don't I don't have exact

**[54:08]** yeah I don't I don't have exact

**[54:08]** yeah I don't I don't have exact benchmarks on like you know how much

**[54:12]** benchmarks on like you know how much

**[54:12]** benchmarks on like you know how much like the transcript gets worse the more

**[54:15]** like the transcript gets worse the more

**[54:15]** like the transcript gets worse the more languages you introduce kind of in the

**[54:17]** languages you introduce kind of in the

**[54:17]** languages you introduce kind of in the same so I I think like generally if you

**[54:19]** same so I I think like generally if you

**[54:19]** same so I I think like generally if you have two languages intermixed it tends

**[54:24]** have two languages intermixed it tends

**[54:24]** have two languages intermixed it tends to perform okay but like if you're like

**[54:28]** to perform okay but like if you're like

**[54:28]** to perform okay but like if you're like now having like three different

**[54:30]** now having like three different

**[54:30]** now having like three different languages um it just you know

**[54:32]** languages um it just you know

**[54:32]** languages um it just you know progressively tends to to get worse but

**[54:35]** progressively tends to to get worse but

**[54:35]** progressively tends to to get worse but I don't have um exact benchmarks on like

**[54:39]** I don't have um exact benchmarks on like

**[54:39]** I don't have um exact benchmarks on like you know how many languages sort of yeah

**[54:42]** you know how many languages sort of yeah

**[54:42]** you know how many languages sort of yeah okay cool that that's good to know

**[54:45]** okay cool that that's good to know

**[54:45]** okay cool that that's good to know that's what I came up with but yeah it

**[54:47]** that's what I came up with but yeah it

**[54:47]** that's what I came up with but yeah it would be worthwhile if you have like

**[54:48]** would be worthwhile if you have like

**[54:48]** would be worthwhile if you have like recordings of like some of that to like

**[54:51]** recordings of like some of that to like

**[54:51]** recordings of like some of that to like put it through our um transcription

**[54:55]** put it through our um transcription

**[54:55]** put it through our um transcription model and see kind of how how it

**[54:58]** model and see kind of how how it

**[54:58]** model and see kind of how how it performs in like identifying that that


### [55:00 - 56:00]

**[55:01]** performs in like identifying that that

**[55:01]** performs in like identifying that that that would be interesting. Yeah.

**[55:04]** that would be interesting. Yeah.

**[55:04]** that would be interesting. Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Uh say this question

**[55:07]** Cool. Thank you. Uh say this question

**[55:07]** Cool. Thank you. Uh say this question toward the end because it's kind of

**[55:08]** toward the end because it's kind of

**[55:08]** toward the end because it's kind of non-related. So uh I worked on a project

**[55:10]** non-related. So uh I worked on a project

**[55:10]** non-related. So uh I worked on a project where we use 11 Labs uh for uh the voice

**[55:14]** where we use 11 Labs uh for uh the voice

**[55:14]** where we use 11 Labs uh for uh the voice track of our avatar. uh and at 11 Labs

**[55:17]** track of our avatar. uh and at 11 Labs

**[55:17]** track of our avatar. uh and at 11 Labs functioned well, but we had a lot of

**[55:18]** functioned well, but we had a lot of

**[55:18]** functioned well, but we had a lot of more downstream issues in terms of like

**[55:21]** more downstream issues in terms of like

**[55:21]** more downstream issues in terms of like lip sync and like I think someone

**[55:23]** lip sync and like I think someone

**[55:23]** lip sync and like I think someone mentioned like slugs and timing and

**[55:25]** mentioned like slugs and timing and

**[55:25]** mentioned like slugs and timing and other things. So, is there any plan for

**[55:27]** other things. So, is there any plan for

**[55:27]** other things. So, is there any plan for 11 laps to come like I guess further

**[55:29]** 11 laps to come like I guess further

**[55:29]** 11 laps to come like I guess further down the stack in terms of like avatars

**[55:32]** down the stack in terms of like avatars

**[55:32]** down the stack in terms of like avatars or is is that even something you're

**[55:34]** or is is that even something you're

**[55:34]** or is is that even something you're thinking about? Uh interesting. So you

**[55:37]** thinking about? Uh interesting. So you

**[55:37]** thinking about? Uh interesting. So you you did you build like the the lip

**[55:40]** you did you build like the the lip

**[55:40]** you did you build like the the lip syncing model and like avatar stuff on

**[55:42]** syncing model and like avatar stuff on

**[55:42]** syncing model and like avatar stuff on your

**[55:44]** your

**[55:44]** your So uh we like within the like Nvidia

**[55:47]** So uh we like within the like Nvidia

**[55:47]** So uh we like within the like Nvidia Tokyo stack. So they have like a a stack

**[55:50]** Tokyo stack. So they have like a a stack

**[55:50]** Tokyo stack. So they have like a a stack and they have their like Reva voice

**[55:52]** and they have their like Reva voice

**[55:52]** and they have their like Reva voice model and we kind of switched that out

**[55:53]** model and we kind of switched that out

**[55:53]** model and we kind of switched that out for 11 Labs. Uh so they have like the

**[55:55]** for 11 Labs. Uh so they have like the

**[55:55]** for 11 Labs. Uh so they have like the full stack of like the avatar and then

**[55:58]** full stack of like the avatar and then
