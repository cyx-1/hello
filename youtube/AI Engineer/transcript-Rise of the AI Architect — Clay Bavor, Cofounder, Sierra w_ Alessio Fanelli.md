### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:02]** own uh branded customerf facing agent

**[02:02]** own uh branded customerf facing agent and we think it's what comes after the

**[02:03]** and we think it's what comes after the

**[02:03]** and we think it's what comes after the website, what comes after the mobile app

**[02:05]** website, what comes after the mobile app

**[02:08]** companies of the world build their own and do it well.

**[02:10]** and do it well.

**[02:10]** and do it well. >> So talking about AI architect, I would

**[02:12]** >> So talking about AI architect, I would

**[02:12]** >> So talking about AI architect, I would say the killer use cases of AI are

**[02:14]** say the killer use cases of AI are

**[02:14]** say the killer use cases of AI are coding and customer support today. um

**[02:17]** coding and customer support today. um

**[02:17]** coding and customer support today. um the coding I would guess vibe coding and

**[02:19]** the coding I would guess vibe coding and

**[02:19]** the coding I would guess vibe coding and some of these ideas are kind of t taking

**[02:21]** some of these ideas are kind of t taking

**[02:21]** some of these ideas are kind of t taking hold

**[02:21]** hold

**[02:21]** hold >> on the customer support side you know

**[02:23]** >> on the customer support side you know

**[02:23]** >> on the customer support side you know Brett mentioned this idea of the AI

**[02:25]** Brett mentioned this idea of the AI

**[02:25]** Brett mentioned this idea of the AI architect where instead of managing

**[02:27]** architect where instead of managing

**[02:27]** architect where instead of managing software you're almost like the

**[02:29]** software you're almost like the

**[02:29]** software you're almost like the personality coach and like really

**[02:31]** personality coach and like really

**[02:31]** personality coach and like really thinking through what's the vibe that

**[02:32]** thinking through what's the vibe that

**[02:32]** thinking through what's the vibe that the agent should have how does it

**[02:34]** the agent should have how does it

**[02:34]** the agent should have how does it integrate so what is an AI architect

**[02:37]** integrate so what is an AI architect

**[02:37]** integrate so what is an AI architect >> so around the emergence of the internet

**[02:40]** >> so around the emergence of the internet

**[02:40]** >> so around the emergence of the internet and the web there was this role of web

**[02:42]** and the web there was this role of web

**[02:42]** and the web there was this role of web master right and you don't really hear

**[02:44]** master right and you don't really hear

**[02:44]** master right and you don't really hear web master thrown around a lot these

**[02:46]** web master thrown around a lot these

**[02:46]** web master thrown around a lot these days, but it was someone who was

**[02:48]** days, but it was someone who was

**[02:48]** days, but it was someone who was creating a company's in essence digital

**[02:50]** creating a company's in essence digital

**[02:50]** creating a company's in essence digital storefront, right? If if they're a

**[02:52]** storefront, right? If if they're a

**[02:52]** storefront, right? If if they're a business and thinking about not only the

**[02:54]** business and thinking about not only the

**[02:54]** business and thinking about not only the technology, right? Uh uh are you

**[02:57]** technology, right? Uh uh are you

**[02:57]** technology, right? Uh uh are you building an ASP or you have static pages

**[02:59]** building an ASP or you have static pages

**[02:59]** building an ASP or you have static pages or or whatever in the dark ages of the


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** or or whatever in the dark ages of the

**[03:01]** or or whatever in the dark ages of the web. Uh but also it's like what does it

**[03:03]** web. Uh but also it's like what does it

**[03:03]** web. Uh but also it's like what does it look like, what does it feel like and

**[03:05]** look like, what does it feel like and

**[03:05]** look like, what does it feel like and and so on. So I think the AI architect I

**[03:07]** and so on. So I think the AI architect I

**[03:07]** and so on. So I think the AI architect I would say is kind of the AI era and AI

**[03:10]** would say is kind of the AI era and AI

**[03:10]** would say is kind of the AI era and AI agent version of the web master in a

**[03:13]** agent version of the web master in a

**[03:13]** agent version of the web master in a way. And it's um it's actually Brett

**[03:15]** way. And it's um it's actually Brett

**[03:15]** way. And it's um it's actually Brett shared on the podcast, it's a role that

**[03:18]** shared on the podcast, it's a role that

**[03:18]** shared on the podcast, it's a role that uh we've seen emerge organically across

**[03:21]** uh we've seen emerge organically across

**[03:21]** uh we've seen emerge organically across a set of our customers. And we heard it

**[03:24]** a set of our customers. And we heard it

**[03:24]** a set of our customers. And we heard it first from one of our largest customers

**[03:25]** first from one of our largest customers

**[03:26]** first from one of our largest customers where the the team of folks who are

**[03:28]** where the the team of folks who are

**[03:28]** where the the team of folks who are responsible for managing, coaching,

**[03:31]** responsible for managing, coaching,

**[03:31]** responsible for managing, coaching, improving, building their agent came to

**[03:34]** improving, building their agent came to

**[03:34]** improving, building their agent came to calling themselves the AI architect. And

**[03:36]** calling themselves the AI architect. And

**[03:36]** calling themselves the AI architect. And I think there are three parts to it. One

**[03:38]** I think there are three parts to it. One

**[03:38]** I think there are three parts to it. One is you got to understand the the

**[03:40]** is you got to understand the the

**[03:40]** is you got to understand the the technology, have a little bit of a feel

**[03:41]** technology, have a little bit of a feel

**[03:41]** technology, have a little bit of a feel for what agents can do. And so doesn't

**[03:44]** for what agents can do. And so doesn't

**[03:44]** for what agents can do. And so doesn't mean that you've, you know, pre-trained

**[03:46]** mean that you've, you know, pre-trained

**[03:46]** mean that you've, you know, pre-trained a a trillion parameter model or uh even

**[03:49]** a a trillion parameter model or uh even

**[03:49]** a a trillion parameter model or uh even been hands-on with a lang chain or um

**[03:52]** been hands-on with a lang chain or um

**[03:52]** been hands-on with a lang chain or um even vibe coding, but having a feel for

**[03:54]** even vibe coding, but having a feel for

**[03:54]** even vibe coding, but having a feel for the capabilities number one. Number two

**[03:56]** the capabilities number one. Number two

**[03:56]** the capabilities number one. Number two is and a pattern we've seen we some

**[03:59]** is and a pattern we've seen we some

**[03:59]** is and a pattern we've seen we some interesting things is a company's agent


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** interesting things is a company's agent

**[12:10]** one of the things we've discovered is

**[12:10]** one of the things we've discovered is the solution to most problems with AI is

**[12:13]** the solution to most problems with AI is

**[12:13]** the solution to most problems with AI is more AI. And so, when you're testing a

**[12:16]** more AI. And so, when you're testing a

**[12:16]** more AI. And so, when you're testing a company's agent, how do you do that? You

**[12:19]** company's agent, how do you do that? You

**[12:19]** company's agent, how do you do that? You can't just put in a single input and

**[12:21]** can't just put in a single input and

**[12:23]** hope you get the the right output. We've

**[12:23]** hope you get the the right output. We've built a whole user simulation testing

**[12:26]** built a whole user simulation testing

**[12:26]** built a whole user simulation testing harness where we can create dozens of

**[12:36]** amber light is on or off and and so on. And so first and foremost have had to

**[12:38]** And so first and foremost have had to

**[12:38]** And so first and foremost have had to think through all of the parts of the

**[12:40]** think through all of the parts of the

**[12:43]** software development life cycle. Um, with that as the foundation, you then

**[12:45]** with that as the foundation, you then

**[12:45]** with that as the foundation, you then have this approach to building out every

**[12:47]** have this approach to building out every

**[12:47]** have this approach to building out every every business's agent, which starts

**[12:55]** are the key customer journeys? And then

**[12:55]** are the key customer journeys? And then we have a variety of techniques for

**[12:57]** we have a variety of techniques for

**[12:57]** we have a variety of techniques for modeling those in code uh in a way that


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:01]** modeling those in code uh in a way that

**[13:01]** modeling those in code uh in a way that is very expressive uh and lets the agent

**[13:04]** is very expressive uh and lets the agent simultaneously kind of hit the curve

**[13:06]** simultaneously kind of hit the curve

**[13:06]** simultaneously kind of hit the curve balls and flex. If someone comes in on

**[14:19]** doesn't work but then it works a month

**[14:19]** doesn't work but then it works a month later because the models improve so

**[15:20]** you're directly uh working in and then I

**[15:20]** you're directly uh working in and then I just think there is no substitute for

**[15:22]** just think there is no substitute for

**[15:22]** just think there is no substitute for hands-on and using it and so uh really

**[15:34]** you're I think is so important and I I would

**[15:36]** I think is so important and I I would

**[15:36]** I think is so important and I I would argue that uh understanding where things

**[15:40]** argue that uh understanding where things

**[15:40]** argue that uh understanding where things are going is even more important than

**[15:43]** are going is even more important than

**[15:43]** are going is even more important than understanding where things are today. So

**[15:45]** understanding where things are today. So

**[15:45]** understanding where things are today. So the first derivative is more important

**[15:47]** the first derivative is more important

**[15:47]** the first derivative is more important than kind of the absolute uh state of

**[15:52]** capability. an example of a decision we

**[15:52]** capability. an example of a decision we made early on was like we had a strong

**[15:54]** made early on was like we had a strong

**[15:54]** made early on was like we had a strong sense when we started the company that

**[15:56]** sense when we started the company that

**[15:56]** sense when we started the company that the uh cost per token was going to

**[15:59]** the uh cost per token was going to

**[15:59]** the uh cost per token was going to plummet that model capabilities were


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:01]** plummet that model capabilities were

**[16:01]** plummet that model capabilities were going to expand and and so you want to

**[16:04]** going to expand and and so you want to

**[16:04]** going to expand and and so you want to be building to where the puck is going

**[16:06]** be building to where the puck is going

**[16:06]** be building to where the puck is going as opposed to where it currently is and

**[16:09]** as opposed to where it currently is and

### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:00]** What What do you think about the next

**[17:00]** What What do you think about the next interface for AI? So we had text, now we

**[17:02]** interface for AI? So we had text, now we

**[17:02]** interface for AI? So we had text, now we have voice, obviously video coming. Do

**[17:04]** have voice, obviously video coming. Do

**[17:09]** it more ambient agents? Like any

**[17:09]** it more ambient agents? Like any thoughts?

**[17:10]** thoughts?

**[17:10]** thoughts? >> Yeah, I first of all, I think how we

**[17:13]** >> Yeah, I first of all, I think how we

**[17:13]** >> Yeah, I first of all, I think how we interact with AI and agents is going to

**[17:15]** interact with AI and agents is going to

**[17:15]** interact with AI and agents is going to look super different from today. Today

**[17:16]** look super different from today. Today

**[17:16]** look super different from today. Today it's like mushed into what looks like

**[17:18]** it's like mushed into what looks like

**[17:18]** it's like mushed into what looks like AOL instant messenger, right? A chat a

**[17:21]** AOL instant messenger, right? A chat a

**[17:21]** AOL instant messenger, right? A chat a chat interface or it's a voice call. I

**[17:24]** chat interface or it's a voice call. I

**[17:24]** chat interface or it's a voice call. I think agents are going to look like

**[17:26]** think agents are going to look like

**[17:26]** think agents are going to look like shape shifters that can summon text,

**[17:30]** shape shifters that can summon text,

**[17:30]** shape shifters that can summon text, voice, video, imagery, user interface,

**[17:43]** uh look, I spent 10 years of my life uh building uh in AR and VR. My strong view

**[17:46]** building uh in AR and VR. My strong view

**[17:46]** building uh in AR and VR. My strong view is that uh glasses and wearables will be

**[17:49]** is that uh glasses and wearables will be

**[17:49]** is that uh glasses and wearables will be the ultimate vehicle for the trusted

**[17:51]** the ultimate vehicle for the trusted

**[17:51]** the ultimate vehicle for the trusted personal AI that is with you. Something

**[17:58]** hear, uh that can whisper in your ear

**[17:58]** hear, uh that can whisper in your ear or, you know, nudge you that way uh


### [18:00 - 19:00]

**[18:01]** or, you know, nudge you that way uh

**[18:01]** or, you know, nudge you that way uh visually. I I just think we're on this

**[18:04]** visually. I I just think we're on this

**[18:04]** visually. I I just think we're on this path to every one of us having an

**[18:07]** path to every one of us having an

**[18:07]** path to every one of us having an omniresent uh omniapable uh AI assistant

**[18:11]** omniresent uh omniapable uh AI assistant

**[18:11]** omniresent uh omniapable uh AI assistant that can help us navigate the world uh

**[18:14]** that can help us navigate the world uh

**[18:14]** that can help us navigate the world uh lead better and healthier lives uh be

**[18:16]** lead better and healthier lives uh be

**[18:16]** lead better and healthier lives uh be smarter than we are on our own. And I

**[18:19]** smarter than we are on our own. And I

**[18:19]** smarter than we are on our own. And I think, you know, going into your pocket

**[18:20]** think, you know, going into your pocket

**[18:20]** think, you know, going into your pocket or purse or bag to retrieve the, you

**[18:23]** or purse or bag to retrieve the, you

**[18:23]** or purse or bag to retrieve the, you know, rectangle of glass and metal and,

**[18:25]** know, rectangle of glass and metal and,

**[18:25]** know, rectangle of glass and metal and, you know, swipe up and uh whatever it

**[18:28]** you know, swipe up and uh whatever it

**[18:28]** you know, swipe up and uh whatever it is, I I just I think for such an

**[18:30]** is, I I just I think for such an

**[18:30]** is, I I just I think for such an important capability that will feel in

**[18:32]** important capability that will feel in

**[18:32]** important capability that will feel in time like an extension of ourselves, you

**[18:35]** time like an extension of ourselves, you

**[18:35]** time like an extension of ourselves, you you want that to be with you throughout

**[18:37]** you want that to be with you throughout

**[18:37]** you want that to be with you throughout the day. And so I think wearables, I

**[18:39]** the day. And so I think wearables, I

**[18:39]** the day. And so I think wearables, I think glasses will be a a central part

**[18:41]** think glasses will be a a central part

**[18:41]** think glasses will be a a central part of that. And uh it's something I'm I'm

**[18:43]** of that. And uh it's something I'm I'm

**[18:43]** of that. And uh it's something I'm I'm super excited to see emerge.

**[18:45]** super excited to see emerge.

**[18:45]** super excited to see emerge. >> Awesome. Thank you, Clay. Thank you so
