### [ROI Timeline Expectations Accelerating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=413s)
- 2024 survey: 63% expected 3-5 years to realize ROI
- 2025 survey: 67% now expect 1-3 years, 19% expect 6 months-1 year
- Huge pull-forward of ROI realization expectations
- Only 12% now expect 3-5 years (down from 63%)

### [The ROI Measurement Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=469s)
- 78% say ROI will be bigger consideration going forward
- 78% say traditional impact metrics failing to keep up with AI reality
- CIOs reporting existing measurement frameworks inadequate for AI
- This gap led to creation of the Super Intelligent ROI study

### [ROI Study Overview & Methodology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=528s)
- Launched end of October 2024, ~1,000 organizations submitted ~3,500 use cases
- Self-reported data from AI Daily Brief podcast audience
- Eight impact categories: time savings, increased output, quality improvement, new capabilities, decision-making, cost savings, revenue, risk reduction
- First analysis on ~2,500 use cases presented here

### [Overall ROI Results: Strong Positives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=545s)
- 44.3% seeing modest ROI right now
- 37.6% seeing high ROI (significant + transformational)
- Only ~5% experiencing negative ROI
- Caveat: Highly enfranchised audience (listening to daily AI podcast, voluntarily sharing)
- Negative ROI doesn't mean failure—just spent more than gained so far

### [Future ROI Expectations: Sky High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=618s)
- 67% expect increased and high ROI growth over next year
- Very optimistic ground-level view of AI ROI trajectory
- Even 53% of teams currently experiencing negative ROI expect high growth
- Strong confidence in improving returns

### [Time Savings as Default Entry Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=642s)
- Time savings represents ~35% of use cases—the starting point
- Cluster between 1-10 hours saved per week, peak around 5 hours
- 5-10 hours/week = 7-10 work weeks recovered per year
- Very meaningful for enterprises even if not ultimate goal
- Often overlooked amid focus on transformational capabilities

### [Time Savings: More Than Meets the Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=660s)
- Easy to forget the power of 5-10 hours/week savings
- Equals 7-10 full work weeks recovered annually
- Meaningful for enterprises though not the only story
- Productivity gains (output, quality) dominate alongside time savings

### [ROI Distribution by Organization Size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=709s)
- 200-1,000 person orgs: Higher concentration on "increased output" use cases
- These mid-size companies reached scale but still striving for growth
- Focusing on use cases that expand capabilities vs just save time
- Interesting variance in priorities based on company maturity

### [ROI Distribution by Role: C-Suite Leading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=749s)
- C-suite and leaders less focused on time savings
- More focused on increased output and new capabilities
- Leaders even more optimistic and seeing transformational impact than junior employees
- 17% of C-suite/leader use cases already showing transformational impact
- Possible selection bias: C-suite thinking about inherently bigger initiatives

### [Small Organizations Seeing Early Transformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=808s)
- 1-50 person orgs getting more transformational benefit early
- Potential wild differences between 3-person and 40-person companies (needs further study)
- Smaller organizations showing significant early impact
- Plan for second round to dig deeper into small org segment

### [Coding & Software: Highest ROI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=845s)
- Coding/software use cases have higher ROI than average
- Lower negative ROI rates than average
- Confirms 2024's major inflection in coding/engineering AI adoption
- Software development emerging as high-value AI application area

### [Risk Reduction: Rare But Highly Transformational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=863s)
- Only 3.4% of use cases cite risk reduction as primary benefit
- BUT: 25% of risk reduction use cases report transformational ROI (far highest rate)
- Back office, compliance, risk functions benefiting from AI handling high-volume tasks
- Quantity/volume challenges in these areas well-suited to AI capabilities

### [Industry Variations: Healthcare & Manufacturing Lead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=927s)
- Heavy concentration in technology and professional services (expected given audience)
- Healthcare and manufacturing use cases show meaningfully higher impact than average
- Worthy of further study to understand industry-specific patterns
- Not all industries seeing equal AI returns

### [The Automation & Agent Advantage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=997s)
- Most use cases in "first tier": content output, quality, winning back 5 hours/week
- Use cases mentioning automation or agents wildly outperform on self-reported ROI
- Both automation AND agent use cases showing superior returns
- Trend toward next layer of more advanced use cases

### [Multiple Use Cases = Better Results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=1022s)
- Direct correlation: More use cases submitted = better ROI seen
- Speaks to moving beyond single spot experiments
- Systematic, cross-organizational, cross-disciplinary approach pays off
- Echoes McKinsey findings on high-performer characteristics

### [Closing & Next Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQFj6VmuI8&t=1044s)
- Study open for another week, full results early December
- Moving from generic impact conversations to data-driven insights
- Survey available at roisurvey.ai
- Focus on discovering where real impact exists and future directions
