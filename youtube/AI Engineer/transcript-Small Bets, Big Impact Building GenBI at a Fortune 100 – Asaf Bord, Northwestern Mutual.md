**[00:22]** Doesn't this look like something's going to drop from the ceiling? Like a ground

**[00:25]** to drop from the ceiling? Like a ground

**[00:25]** to drop from the ceiling? Like a ground zero type thing? [snorts]

**[00:27]** zero type thing? [snorts]

**[00:27]** zero type thing? [snorts] Be honest. It's like who has the buzzer

**[00:28]** Be honest. It's like who has the buzzer

**[00:28]** Be honest. It's like who has the buzzer that if I'm I really suck, they press it

**[00:31]** that if I'm I really suck, they press it

**[00:31]** that if I'm I really suck, they press it and everything falls down through the

**[00:32]** and everything falls down through the

**[00:32]** and everything falls down through the trap door. No.

**[00:35]** >> Be careful.

**[00:35]** >> Be careful. >> Yeah. Okay. Who was it?

**[00:37]** >> Yeah. Okay. Who was it?

**[00:37]** >> Yeah. Okay. Who was it? >> Okay. You tell me if I'm doing okay or

**[00:39]** >> Okay. You tell me if I'm doing okay or

**[00:39]** >> Okay. You tell me if I'm doing okay or if I should take a couple of steps back.

**[00:40]** if I should take a couple of steps back.

**[00:40]** if I should take a couple of steps back. Right. So, hi everyone. I'm Assaf. Um,

**[00:45]** Right. So, hi everyone. I'm Assaf. Um,

**[00:45]** Right. So, hi everyone. I'm Assaf. Um, and I'm here to talk about Genbi. And

**[00:47]** and I'm here to talk about Genbi. And

**[00:47]** and I'm here to talk about Genbi. And kind of first disclaimer, this

**[00:49]** kind of first disclaimer, this

**[00:49]** kind of first disclaimer, this presentation was not created with Gen

**[00:50]** presentation was not created with Gen

**[00:50]** presentation was not created with Gen AI. Um to be honest, I actually started

**[00:54]** AI. Um to be honest, I actually started

**[00:54]** AI. Um to be honest, I actually started doing it uh with uh GPT03 back in

**[00:57]** doing it uh with uh GPT03 back in

**[00:57]** doing it uh with uh GPT03 back in August. [snorts] Uh and then I did kind


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** August. [snorts] Uh and then I did kind

**[01:00]** August. [snorts] Uh and then I did kind of a first draft and then a couple of

**[01:02]** of a first draft and then a couple of

**[01:02]** of a first draft and then a couple of weeks back I wanted to come in and

**[01:03]** weeks back I wanted to come in and

**[01:03]** weeks back I wanted to come in and refresh it before the conference and

**[01:05]** refresh it before the conference and

**[01:05]** refresh it before the conference and then GPT5 took over completely messed up

**[01:09]** then GPT5 took over completely messed up

**[01:09]** then GPT5 took over completely messed up my slides. So I ended up doing it

**[01:12]** my slides. So I ended up doing it

**[01:12]** my slides. So I ended up doing it manually kind of old-fashioned. So if

**[01:13]** manually kind of old-fashioned. So if

**[01:13]** manually kind of old-fashioned. So if I'm missing like an M dash somewhere in

**[01:16]** I'm missing like an M dash somewhere in

**[01:16]** I'm missing like an M dash somewhere in the middle, let me know after. Okay.

**[01:18]** the middle, let me know after. Okay.

**[01:18]** the middle, let me know after. Okay. [snorts]

**[01:19]** [snorts]

**[01:19]** [snorts] Uh so first of all, a bit of

**[01:21]** Uh so first of all, a bit of

**[01:21]** Uh so first of all, a bit of housekeeping. What's GenBBI? So, it's a

**[01:23]** housekeeping. What's GenBBI? So, it's a

**[01:23]** housekeeping. What's GenBBI? So, it's a fusion of Gen AI and BI. It's basically

**[01:25]** fusion of Gen AI and BI. It's basically

**[01:25]** fusion of Gen AI and BI. It's basically an agent that helps people answer

**[01:28]** an agent that helps people answer

**[01:28]** an agent that helps people answer business questions with data like a a

**[01:31]** business questions with data like a a

**[01:31]** business questions with data like a a business intelligence person would do in

**[01:32]** business intelligence person would do in

**[01:32]** business intelligence person would do in real life. [snorts] Uh, the reason that

**[01:35]** real life. [snorts] Uh, the reason that

**[01:35]** real life. [snorts] Uh, the reason that we're pursuing GenBI is really because

**[01:36]** we're pursuing GenBI is really because

**[01:36]** we're pursuing GenBI is really because of the data democratization that it can

**[01:38]** of the data democratization that it can

**[01:38]** of the data democratization that it can bring, right? So having access to data

**[01:41]** bring, right? So having access to data

**[01:41]** bring, right? So having access to data at your fingertips without having to be

**[01:43]** at your fingertips without having to be

**[01:43]** at your fingertips without having to be reliant on a BI team that helps you find

**[01:45]** reliant on a BI team that helps you find

**[01:45]** reliant on a BI team that helps you find a report, figure out what it means, uh,

**[01:48]** a report, figure out what it means, uh,

**[01:48]** a report, figure out what it means, uh, understand your world before they can

**[01:50]** understand your world before they can

**[01:50]** understand your world before they can even give you any kind of input. Uh, so

**[01:53]** even give you any kind of input. Uh, so

**[01:53]** even give you any kind of input. Uh, so that's GenBBI. Uh, a bit about

**[01:55]** that's GenBBI. Uh, a bit about

**[01:55]** that's GenBBI. Uh, a bit about Northwestern Mutual. That's where I

**[01:57]** Northwestern Mutual. That's where I

**[01:57]** Northwestern Mutual. That's where I work. So we're a financial services,

**[01:59]** work. So we're a financial services,


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** work. So we're a financial services, life insurance, and wealth management.

**[02:01]** life insurance, and wealth management.

**[02:01]** life insurance, and wealth management. Been around for 160 years. [snorts] Uh,

**[02:04]** Been around for 160 years. [snorts] Uh,

**[02:04]** Been around for 160 years. [snorts] Uh, some very impressive numbers there. But

**[02:06]** some very impressive numbers there. But

**[02:06]** some very impressive numbers there. But first of all, I want to say why is

**[02:08]** first of all, I want to say why is

**[02:08]** first of all, I want to say why is Northwestern Mutual a great place to do

**[02:10]** Northwestern Mutual a great place to do

**[02:10]** Northwestern Mutual a great place to do Gen AI. We got a lot of data, we got a

**[02:13]** Gen AI. We got a lot of data, we got a

**[02:13]** Gen AI. We got a lot of data, we got a lot of money, we got a lot of use cases,

**[02:16]** lot of money, we got a lot of use cases,

**[02:16]** lot of money, we got a lot of use cases, and we got access to some of the best

**[02:17]** and we got access to some of the best

**[02:17]** and we got access to some of the best talent uh anyone can dream of. Really

**[02:20]** talent uh anyone can dream of. Really

**[02:20]** talent uh anyone can dream of. Really truly humbled by the people that I get

**[02:22]** truly humbled by the people that I get

**[02:22]** truly humbled by the people that I get to work with. Um but on the flip side,

**[02:26]** to work with. Um but on the flip side,

**[02:26]** to work with. Um but on the flip side, why is it hard to do Gen AI at

**[02:28]** why is it hard to do Gen AI at

**[02:28]** why is it hard to do Gen AI at Northwestern Mutual? Because it is a

**[02:30]** Northwestern Mutual? Because it is a

**[02:30]** Northwestern Mutual? Because it is a very riskaverse company, right? If you

**[02:33]** very riskaverse company, right? If you

**[02:33]** very riskaverse company, right? If you think about it, our main motto is

**[02:35]** think about it, our main motto is

**[02:35]** think about it, our main motto is generational responsibility. I call it

**[02:38]** generational responsibility. I call it

**[02:38]** generational responsibility. I call it don't f up. Uh because what we end

**[02:41]** don't f up. Uh because what we end

**[02:41]** don't f up. Uh because what we end up selling to people is a decadesl long

**[02:45]** up selling to people is a decadesl long

**[02:45]** up selling to people is a decadesl long commitment, right? You buy life

**[02:48]** commitment, right? You buy life

**[02:48]** commitment, right? You buy life insurance now. Uh if you stay with us

**[02:52]** insurance now. Uh if you stay with us

**[02:52]** insurance now. Uh if you stay with us until it comes to term, so to speak,

**[02:55]** until it comes to term, so to speak,

**[02:55]** until it comes to term, so to speak, that can be 20, 40, 80 years down the

**[02:58]** that can be 20, 40, 80 years down the

**[02:58]** that can be 20, 40, 80 years down the line, depending on when you buy it and

**[02:59]** line, depending on when you buy it and

**[02:59]** line, depending on when you buy it and how long you get to live. And so


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** how long you get to live. And so

**[03:01]** how long you get to live. And so stability is something that's very

**[03:04]** stability is something that's very

**[03:04]** stability is something that's very important for us because it's important

**[03:05]** important for us because it's important

**[03:05]** important for us because it's important for our clients. So how do we balance

**[03:08]** for our clients. So how do we balance

**[03:08]** for our clients. So how do we balance stability with innovation? That's what I

**[03:11]** stability with innovation? That's what I

**[03:11]** stability with innovation? That's what I want to talk about today. Um and really

**[03:14]** want to talk about today. Um and really

**[03:14]** want to talk about today. Um and really the four main challenges that we had

**[03:17]** the four main challenges that we had

**[03:17]** the four main challenges that we had when we even came up with the idea kind

**[03:19]** when we even came up with the idea kind

**[03:20]** when we even came up with the idea kind of a pie in the sky Genbi concept. Uh

**[03:23]** of a pie in the sky Genbi concept. Uh

**[03:23]** of a pie in the sky Genbi concept. Uh [snorts] first of all, no one's done it

**[03:24]** [snorts] first of all, no one's done it

**[03:24]** [snorts] first of all, no one's done it before, right? Truly, no one's done

**[03:26]** before, right? Truly, no one's done

**[03:26]** before, right? Truly, no one's done Genbi in this fashion in the past. Uh

**[03:29]** Genbi in this fashion in the past. Uh

**[03:29]** Genbi in this fashion in the past. Uh secondly, and this was really a

**[03:31]** secondly, and this was really a

**[03:31]** secondly, and this was really a preference for us. We wanted to use

**[03:34]** preference for us. We wanted to use

**[03:34]** preference for us. We wanted to use actual data that's messy because we knew

**[03:37]** actual data that's messy because we knew

**[03:37]** actual data that's messy because we knew that those were that's where the real

**[03:40]** that those were that's where the real

**[03:40]** that those were that's where the real challenges are going to be, right?

**[03:41]** challenges are going to be, right?

**[03:41]** challenges are going to be, right? Understanding actual messy data for 160y

**[03:44]** Understanding actual messy data for 160y

**[03:44]** Understanding actual messy data for 160y old company and how can we perform well

**[03:47]** old company and how can we perform well

**[03:47]** old company and how can we perform well within that ecosystem. Um the third was

**[03:51]** within that ecosystem. Um the third was

**[03:51]** within that ecosystem. Um the third was kind of a blind trust bias. So um the bi

**[03:55]** kind of a blind trust bias. So um the bi

**[03:55]** kind of a blind trust bias. So um the bi the trust that we had to build was both

**[03:57]** the trust that we had to build was both

**[03:57]** the trust that we had to build was both with the users but also with the

**[03:59]** with the users but also with the

**[03:59]** with the users but also with the leadership of the company right how can


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:02]** leadership of the company right how can

**[04:02]** leadership of the company right how can we bring accurate information accurate

**[04:04]** we bring accurate information accurate

**[04:04]** we bring accurate information accurate answers to people when uh all of these

**[04:08]** answers to people when uh all of these

**[04:08]** answers to people when uh all of these things that we know about and everyone's

**[04:09]** things that we know about and everyone's

**[04:09]** things that we know about and everyone's talked about is is just out there right

**[04:11]** talked about is is just out there right

**[04:11]** talked about is is just out there right no one's blind to the trust barriers no

**[04:14]** no one's blind to the trust barriers no

**[04:14]** no one's blind to the trust barriers no one's blind to the accuracy barriers so

**[04:16]** one's blind to the accuracy barriers so

**[04:16]** one's blind to the accuracy barriers so how do we convince that this is actually

**[04:17]** how do we convince that this is actually

**[04:17]** how do we convince that this is actually something that we can trust in the

**[04:20]** something that we can trust in the

**[04:20]** something that we can trust in the company and lastly

**[04:23]** company and lastly

**[04:23]** company and lastly Um but really firstly when we go to

**[04:26]** Um but really firstly when we go to

**[04:26]** Um but really firstly when we go to approach this from an enterprise

**[04:27]** approach this from an enterprise

**[04:27]** approach this from an enterprise perspective [snorts] budget the impact

**[04:29]** perspective [snorts] budget the impact

**[04:29]** perspective [snorts] budget the impact right how do we convince someone in a

**[04:32]** right how do we convince someone in a

**[04:32]** right how do we convince someone in a leadership uh organization where risk

**[04:34]** leadership uh organization where risk

**[04:34]** leadership uh organization where risk aversement is ingrained in the DNA to

**[04:38]** aversement is ingrained in the DNA to

**[04:38]** aversement is ingrained in the DNA to even invest in something like this that

**[04:40]** even invest in something like this that

**[04:40]** even invest in something like this that no one's done before we don't really

**[04:42]** no one's done before we don't really

**[04:42]** no one's done before we don't really know how we would do it uh we're not

**[04:44]** know how we would do it uh we're not

**[04:44]** know how we would do it uh we're not even sure how it would look like when it

**[04:45]** even sure how it would look like when it

**[04:45]** even sure how it would look like when it comes to turn

**[04:48]** comes to turn

**[04:48]** comes to turn uh so I'll start kind of one by one uh

**[04:51]** uh so I'll start kind of one by one uh

**[04:51]** uh so I'll start kind of one by one uh and first of all really talk about why

**[04:53]** and first of all really talk about why

**[04:53]** and first of all really talk about why we chose to use actual data uh and not

**[04:56]** we chose to use actual data uh and not

**[04:56]** we chose to use actual data uh and not synthesized data or cleanse data.

**[04:58]** synthesized data or cleanse data.

**[04:58]** synthesized data or cleanse data. >> [snorts]

**[04:58]** >> [snorts]

**[04:58]** >> [snorts] >> Uh so really it's about making sure that


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** >> Uh so really it's about making sure that

**[05:00]** >> Uh so really it's about making sure that we understand the actual complexities

**[05:02]** we understand the actual complexities

**[05:02]** we understand the actual complexities that we will have to face when we

**[05:05]** that we will have to face when we

**[05:05]** that we will have to face when we eventually want to go to production

**[05:06]** eventually want to go to production

**[05:06]** eventually want to go to production right we know that you know building uh

**[05:09]** right we know that you know building uh

**[05:09]** right we know that you know building uh PC's and demos is so easy but the gap

**[05:12]** PC's and demos is so easy but the gap

**[05:12]** PC's and demos is so easy but the gap from PC to production is so broad uh

**[05:14]** from PC to production is so broad uh

**[05:14]** from PC to production is so broad uh especially in this gen AI space

**[05:16]** especially in this gen AI space

**[05:16]** especially in this gen AI space especially because we don't know upfront

**[05:18]** especially because we don't know upfront

**[05:18]** especially because we don't know upfront how to design the system what we would

**[05:20]** how to design the system what we would

**[05:20]** how to design the system what we would expect it to behave like so making sure

**[05:23]** expect it to behave like so making sure

**[05:23]** expect it to behave like so making sure that we operate with real data just gave

**[05:25]** that we operate with real data just gave

**[05:25]** that we operate with real data just gave us that extra confidence that when

**[05:26]** us that extra confidence that when

**[05:26]** us that extra confidence that when something works in the lab it's very

**[05:28]** something works in the lab it's very

**[05:28]** something works in the lab it's very likely to also work in reality. Uh but

**[05:32]** likely to also work in reality. Uh but

**[05:32]** likely to also work in reality. Uh but also and maybe not uh in the least less

**[05:36]** also and maybe not uh in the least less

**[05:36]** also and maybe not uh in the least less important is that we got to work with

**[05:38]** important is that we got to work with

**[05:38]** important is that we got to work with actual people who work with the data day

**[05:40]** actual people who work with the data day

**[05:40]** actual people who work with the data day in and day out and that gave us two

**[05:42]** in and day out and that gave us two

**[05:42]** in and day out and that gave us two things. Okay, first of all subject

**[05:44]** things. Okay, first of all subject

**[05:44]** things. Okay, first of all subject matter expertise which are super

**[05:45]** matter expertise which are super

**[05:46]** matter expertise which are super critical for us to be able to validate

**[05:47]** critical for us to be able to validate

**[05:47]** critical for us to be able to validate that the system is actually working gave

**[05:49]** that the system is actually working gave

**[05:49]** that the system is actually working gave us a lot of real life examples of what

**[05:51]** us a lot of real life examples of what

**[05:51]** us a lot of real life examples of what people are actually asking in a

**[05:53]** people are actually asking in a

**[05:54]** people are actually asking in a corporate and what people have answered

**[05:55]** corporate and what people have answered

**[05:55]** corporate and what people have answered to them. So basically the eval right and

**[05:58]** to them. So basically the eval right and

**[05:58]** to them. So basically the eval right and all the testing and stuff. Uh but at the


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** all the testing and stuff. Uh but at the

**[06:00]** all the testing and stuff. Uh but at the end of the day it also brought the

**[06:04]** end of the day it also brought the

**[06:04]** end of the day it also brought the business to be a part of the research

**[06:06]** business to be a part of the research

**[06:06]** business to be a part of the research project itself and they became kind of

**[06:09]** project itself and they became kind of

**[06:09]** project itself and they became kind of bought into the idea as part of the

**[06:11]** bought into the idea as part of the

**[06:11]** bought into the idea as part of the process. So we didn't just test

**[06:13]** process. So we didn't just test

**[06:14]** process. So we didn't just test something in the lab and then had to

**[06:15]** something in the lab and then had to

**[06:15]** something in the lab and then had to convince someone to go ahead and use it.

**[06:18]** convince someone to go ahead and use it.

**[06:18]** convince someone to go ahead and use it. The end users were part of the research

**[06:21]** The end users were part of the research

**[06:21]** The end users were part of the research process itself. And so when eventually

**[06:23]** process itself. And so when eventually

**[06:23]** process itself. And so when eventually it matured enough so we can take some of

**[06:25]** it matured enough so we can take some of

**[06:25]** it matured enough so we can take some of that to production, they were already

**[06:28]** that to production, they were already

**[06:28]** that to production, they were already there and they actually were pulling

**[06:29]** there and they actually were pulling

**[06:29]** there and they actually were pulling that. They told us we want to take this,

**[06:31]** that. They told us we want to take this,

**[06:31]** that. They told us we want to take this, how can we wrap it, how can we package

**[06:33]** how can we wrap it, how can we package

**[06:33]** how can we wrap it, how can we package it uh quickly enough so we can put it

**[06:35]** it uh quickly enough so we can put it

**[06:35]** it uh quickly enough so we can put it into practice.

**[06:40]** Uh and the next part was really about

**[06:40]** Uh and the next part was really about building trust. Uh so this is about

**[06:43]** building trust. Uh so this is about

**[06:43]** building trust. Uh so this is about building trust first of all with our

**[06:45]** building trust first of all with our

**[06:45]** building trust first of all with our management team. All right. Now, I don't

**[06:47]** management team. All right. Now, I don't

**[06:47]** management team. All right. Now, I don't know about you, but last time that I got

**[06:49]** know about you, but last time that I got

**[06:49]** know about you, but last time that I got a million dollar to do a research

**[06:51]** a million dollar to do a research

**[06:51]** a million dollar to do a research project that I wanted in a pie sky idea.

**[06:53]** project that I wanted in a pie sky idea.

**[06:53]** project that I wanted in a pie sky idea. I woke up from the dream and I realized

**[06:56]** I woke up from the dream and I realized

**[06:56]** I woke up from the dream and I realized that this is not how things work in

**[06:58]** that this is not how things work in

**[06:58]** that this is not how things work in reality. You don't just get a million

**[06:59]** reality. You don't just get a million

**[06:59]** reality. You don't just get a million dollars and go ahead and try something


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** dollars and go ahead and try something

**[07:01]** dollars and go ahead and try something out. Uh, you had to show that you know

**[07:04]** out. Uh, you had to show that you know

**[07:04]** out. Uh, you had to show that you know what you're doing. And part of what we

**[07:06]** what you're doing. And part of what we

**[07:06]** what you're doing. And part of what we did, it's kind of listed out here, but

**[07:09]** did, it's kind of listed out here, but

**[07:09]** did, it's kind of listed out here, but obviously, you know, we did all the

**[07:10]** obviously, you know, we did all the

**[07:10]** obviously, you know, we did all the regular stuff, right? We worked in a

**[07:12]** regular stuff, right? We worked in a

**[07:12]** regular stuff, right? We worked in a sandbox environment. We made sure that

**[07:13]** sandbox environment. We made sure that

**[07:14]** sandbox environment. We made sure that we're not using actual client data. We

**[07:16]** we're not using actual client data. We

**[07:16]** we're not using actual client data. We made sure to put in all the security

**[07:17]** made sure to put in all the security

**[07:17]** made sure to put in all the security risk aside. But uh one of the first

**[07:21]** risk aside. But uh one of the first

**[07:21]** risk aside. But uh one of the first approaches that we said we're going to

**[07:22]** approaches that we said we're going to

**[07:22]** approaches that we said we're going to take is we're not just going to build a

**[07:24]** take is we're not just going to build a

**[07:24]** take is we're not just going to build a tool that's going to be uh released to

**[07:27]** tool that's going to be uh released to

**[07:27]** tool that's going to be uh released to everyone, right? We understood very

**[07:29]** everyone, right? We understood very

**[07:30]** everyone, right? We understood very quickly that um how people interact with

**[07:34]** quickly that um how people interact with

**[07:34]** quickly that um how people interact with the tool, their ability to verify that

**[07:37]** the tool, their ability to verify that

**[07:37]** the tool, their ability to verify that what they're getting is right and also

**[07:39]** what they're getting is right and also

**[07:39]** what they're getting is right and also give us feedback changes dramatically

**[07:41]** give us feedback changes dramatically

**[07:41]** give us feedback changes dramatically depending on their expertise and

**[07:42]** depending on their expertise and

**[07:42]** depending on their expertise and understanding of the data. So we took

**[07:44]** understanding of the data. So we took

**[07:44]** understanding of the data. So we took that crawl, walk, run approach that

**[07:46]** that crawl, walk, run approach that

**[07:46]** that crawl, walk, run approach that basically said we're first going to

**[07:48]** basically said we're first going to

**[07:48]** basically said we're first going to release it to actual BI experts, right?

**[07:52]** release it to actual BI experts, right?

**[07:52]** release it to actual BI experts, right? people that would be able to do it on

**[07:54]** people that would be able to do it on

**[07:54]** people that would be able to do it on their own and know what good looks like

**[07:56]** their own and know what good looks like

**[07:56]** their own and know what good looks like when they get it. And we're just going

**[07:58]** when they get it. And we're just going

**[07:58]** when they get it. And we're just going to expedite the process for them kind of


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** to expedite the process for them kind of

**[08:00]** to expedite the process for them kind of like a GitHub co-pilot. The next phase

**[08:02]** like a GitHub co-pilot. The next phase

**[08:02]** like a GitHub co-pilot. The next phase would be to bring it to business

**[08:04]** would be to bring it to business

**[08:04]** would be to bring it to business managers and again people who are closer

**[08:06]** managers and again people who are closer

**[08:06]** managers and again people who are closer to the BI team, but when they see a

**[08:09]** to the BI team, but when they see a

**[08:09]** to the BI team, but when they see a mistake, they can pretty much figure out

**[08:12]** mistake, they can pretty much figure out

**[08:12]** mistake, they can pretty much figure out that what they're seeing is wrong

**[08:13]** that what they're seeing is wrong

**[08:13]** that what they're seeing is wrong because they're used to seeing that on

**[08:15]** because they're used to seeing that on

**[08:15]** because they're used to seeing that on day-to-day basis. um and they will might

**[08:18]** day-to-day basis. um and they will might

**[08:18]** day-to-day basis. um and they will might be less sensitive to these types of

**[08:19]** be less sensitive to these types of

**[08:19]** be less sensitive to these types of mistakes and be more inclined to give us

**[08:21]** mistakes and be more inclined to give us

**[08:21]** mistakes and be more inclined to give us that feedback instead of just, you know,

**[08:23]** that feedback instead of just, you know,

**[08:23]** that feedback instead of just, you know, dumping it aside and never using it

**[08:25]** dumping it aside and never using it

**[08:25]** dumping it aside and never using it again. Giving this type of tool to

**[08:27]** again. Giving this type of tool to

**[08:27]** again. Giving this type of tool to executives in the company, I don't even

**[08:29]** executives in the company, I don't even

**[08:29]** executives in the company, I don't even know when we're going to get there,

**[08:31]** know when we're going to get there,

**[08:31]** know when we're going to get there, right? Like an executive, they want

**[08:33]** right? Like an executive, they want

**[08:33]** right? Like an executive, they want clear, concise answers that they know

**[08:36]** clear, concise answers that they know

**[08:36]** clear, concise answers that they know they can trust. We're definitely not

**[08:38]** they can trust. We're definitely not

**[08:38]** they can trust. We're definitely not there yet. I think that's the vision uh

**[08:56]** well, in the get-go, we're not going to even try to build SQLs, right? This is


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** even try to build SQLs, right? This is

**[09:00]** even try to build SQLs, right? This is very complex. This is very hard even for

**[09:03]** very complex. This is very hard even for

**[09:03]** very complex. This is very hard even for a person. So, we said step number one,

**[09:05]** a person. So, we said step number one,

**[09:06]** a person. So, we said step number one, let's just bring information that is

**[09:08]** let's just bring information that is

**[09:08]** let's just bring information that is already in the ecosystem that's already

**[09:10]** already in the ecosystem that's already

**[09:10]** already in the ecosystem that's already verified, right? We have a lot of uh

**[09:12]** verified, right? We have a lot of uh

**[09:12]** verified, right? We have a lot of uh certified reports and dashboards. Um and

**[09:15]** certified reports and dashboards. Um and

**[09:15]** certified reports and dashboards. Um and actually in the conversations we had

**[09:16]** actually in the conversations we had

**[09:16]** actually in the conversations we had with some of the BI teams that we worked

**[09:19]** with some of the BI teams that we worked

**[09:19]** with some of the BI teams that we worked with, they told us guys like 80% of the

**[09:21]** with, they told us guys like 80% of the

**[09:22]** with, they told us guys like 80% of the work that we do is basically sending

**[09:23]** work that we do is basically sending

**[09:23]** work that we do is basically sending people to the right report and helping

**[09:25]** people to the right report and helping

**[09:25]** people to the right report and helping them figure out how to use it. So the

**[09:27]** them figure out how to use it. So the

**[09:27]** them figure out how to use it. So the report is already there. Um and that

**[09:30]** report is already there. Um and that

**[09:30]** report is already there. Um and that again built some inherent trust into how

**[09:33]** again built some inherent trust into how

**[09:33]** again built some inherent trust into how we architected the system because we

**[09:34]** we architected the system because we

**[09:34]** we architected the system because we said we're not going to make up

**[09:36]** said we're not going to make up

**[09:36]** said we're not going to make up information. we're just going to deliver

**[09:38]** information. we're just going to deliver

**[09:39]** you the same asset that you would have

**[09:39]** you the same asset that you would have gotten anyway just in a much faster much

**[09:42]** gotten anyway just in a much faster much

**[09:42]** gotten anyway just in a much faster much more interactive way. Uh and that was

**[09:44]** more interactive way. Uh and that was

**[09:44]** more interactive way. Uh and that was the alignment of expectations that we

**[09:46]** the alignment of expectations that we

**[09:46]** the alignment of expectations that we did very upfront with the uh users and

**[09:49]** did very upfront with the uh users and

**[09:49]** did very upfront with the uh users and also with the management team.

**[09:51]** also with the management team.

**[09:51]** also with the management team. Now [clears throat]

**[09:53]** Now [clears throat]

**[09:54]** Now [clears throat] the biggest um

**[09:57]** the biggest um

**[09:57]** the biggest um process or kind of the most important

**[09:59]** process or kind of the most important

**[09:59]** process or kind of the most important approach that we took when uh


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:01]** approach that we took when uh

**[10:01]** approach that we took when uh approaching our leadership team and

**[10:02]** approaching our leadership team and

**[10:02]** approaching our leadership team and convincing them that we want to do this

**[10:05]** convincing them that we want to do this

**[10:05]** convincing them that we want to do this was to create a very gradual incremental

**[10:08]** was to create a very gradual incremental

**[10:08]** was to create a very gradual incremental process that gave them a lot of

**[10:10]** process that gave them a lot of

**[10:10]** process that gave them a lot of visibility and control. Uh and it was

**[10:13]** visibility and control. Uh and it was

**[10:13]** visibility and control. Uh and it was very important for us to build

**[10:15]** very important for us to build

**[10:15]** very important for us to build incremental deliveries throughout that

**[10:17]** incremental deliveries throughout that

**[10:17]** incremental deliveries throughout that process so that [snorts] uh not only did

**[10:20]** process so that [snorts] uh not only did

**[10:20]** process so that [snorts] uh not only did they have the the visibility into what

**[10:22]** they have the the visibility into what

**[10:22]** they have the the visibility into what are we funding now, what do we get out

**[10:25]** are we funding now, what do we get out

**[10:25]** are we funding now, what do we get out of it, they actually had business

**[10:26]** of it, they actually had business

**[10:26]** of it, they actually had business deliverables they could realize

**[10:28]** deliverables they could realize

**[10:28]** deliverables they could realize potential from throughout the process

**[10:31]** potential from throughout the process

**[10:31]** potential from throughout the process and at any point in time they could pull

**[10:33]** and at any point in time they could pull

**[10:33]** and at any point in time they could pull the plug right and say okay like it's

**[10:35]** the plug right and say okay like it's

**[10:35]** the plug right and say okay like it's not working well or we got enough out of

**[10:37]** not working well or we got enough out of

**[10:37]** not working well or we got enough out of it or you know the next phase is so you

**[10:40]** it or you know the next phase is so you

**[10:40]** it or you know the next phase is so you know unknown and long that we don't want

**[10:42]** know unknown and long that we don't want

**[10:42]** know unknown and long that we don't want further invest in it. And this is how we

**[10:44]** further invest in it. And this is how we

**[10:44]** further invest in it. And this is how we basically broke it down. So phase one

**[10:47]** basically broke it down. So phase one

**[10:47]** basically broke it down. So phase one was just pure research, right? We kind

**[10:49]** was just pure research, right? We kind

**[10:49]** was just pure research, right? We kind of did the shift from natural language

**[10:51]** of did the shift from natural language

**[10:51]** of did the shift from natural language to SQL. We figured out how to write

**[10:53]** to SQL. We figured out how to write

**[10:53]** to SQL. We figured out how to write responses. We figure out how to

**[10:55]** responses. We figure out how to

**[10:55]** responses. We figure out how to understand questions that coming in.

**[10:57]** understand questions that coming in.

**[10:57]** understand questions that coming in. Just kind of setting the stage. [snorts]

**[10:59]** Just kind of setting the stage. [snorts]

**[10:59]** Just kind of setting the stage. [snorts] Phase two was about really


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** Phase two was about really

**[11:00]** Phase two was about really understanding, okay, so what does good

**[11:03]** understanding, okay, so what does good

**[11:03]** understanding, okay, so what does good metadata and good context look like in

**[11:06]** metadata and good context look like in

**[11:06]** metadata and good context look like in the perspective of a BI agent, right? It

**[11:08]** the perspective of a BI agent, right? It

**[11:08]** the perspective of a BI agent, right? It looks very different if you're just

**[11:09]** looks very different if you're just

**[11:10]** looks very different if you're just chatting with something or if you're

**[11:11]** chatting with something or if you're

**[11:11]** chatting with something or if you're trying to do a rag with you know

**[11:13]** trying to do a rag with you know

**[11:13]** trying to do a rag with you know unstructured data like documents and uh

**[11:16]** unstructured data like documents and uh

**[11:16]** unstructured data like documents and uh business knowledge and stuff like that.

**[11:18]** business knowledge and stuff like that.

**[11:18]** business knowledge and stuff like that. And this phase on its own already had uh

**[11:21]** And this phase on its own already had uh

**[11:21]** And this phase on its own already had uh impact on the business because when we

**[11:23]** impact on the business because when we

**[11:23]** impact on the business because when we define what good metadata looks like for

**[11:24]** define what good metadata looks like for

**[11:24]** define what good metadata looks like for an an LLM uh we could immediately apply

**[11:29]** an an LLM uh we could immediately apply

**[11:29]** an an LLM uh we could immediately apply that also to just the ecosystem of data

**[11:31]** that also to just the ecosystem of data

**[11:32]** that also to just the ecosystem of data users across the enterprise. Um, and by

**[11:35]** users across the enterprise. Um, and by

**[11:35]** users across the enterprise. Um, and by understanding how to extract LM from the

**[11:37]** understanding how to extract LM from the

**[11:37]** understanding how to extract LM from the information, we could also how to

**[11:39]** information, we could also how to

**[11:40]** information, we could also how to extract metadata. Sorry, here's where

**[11:42]** extract metadata. Sorry, here's where

**[11:42]** extract metadata. Sorry, here's where [snorts] the trap door comes into play,

**[11:43]** [snorts] the trap door comes into play,

**[11:43]** [snorts] the trap door comes into play, right? Um, we could also project that on

**[11:47]** right? Um, we could also project that on

**[11:47]** right? Um, we could also project that on how or what good metadata looks like for

**[11:50]** how or what good metadata looks like for

**[11:50]** how or what good metadata looks like for humans interacting with the data. We

**[11:52]** humans interacting with the data. We

**[11:52]** humans interacting with the data. We have another initiative around semantic

**[11:54]** have another initiative around semantic

**[11:54]** have another initiative around semantic layer going on which tries to model

**[11:56]** layer going on which tries to model

**[11:56]** layer going on which tries to model exactly that and this provided a very

**[11:58]** exactly that and this provided a very

**[11:58]** exactly that and this provided a very valuable input to that initiative as


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** valuable input to that initiative as

**[12:00]** valuable input to that initiative as well. But the immediate next step was

**[12:02]** well. But the immediate next step was

**[12:02]** well. But the immediate next step was basically just doing this kind of uh

**[12:05]** basically just doing this kind of uh

**[12:05]** basically just doing this kind of uh multicontext semantic search, right?

**[12:07]** multicontext semantic search, right?

**[12:07]** multicontext semantic search, right? People coming in asking different

**[12:08]** People coming in asking different

**[12:08]** People coming in asking different questions and having the system figure

**[12:11]** questions and having the system figure

**[12:11]** questions and having the system figure out what's the right context, what's the

**[12:13]** out what's the right context, what's the

**[12:13]** out what's the right context, what's the right information we need in uh bring

**[12:15]** right information we need in uh bring

**[12:15]** right information we need in uh bring them. And this is something that could

**[12:16]** them. And this is something that could

**[12:16]** them. And this is something that could already be packaged as its own product

**[12:19]** already be packaged as its own product

**[12:19]** already be packaged as its own product and delivered uh and basically just do

**[12:22]** and delivered uh and basically just do

**[12:22]** and delivered uh and basically just do kind of a data finder and data owner

**[12:25]** kind of a data finder and data owner

**[12:25]** kind of a data finder and data owner finder which is something that could

**[12:28]** finder which is something that could

**[12:28]** finder which is something that could take anywhere between two to maybe four

**[12:30]** take anywhere between two to maybe four

**[12:30]** take anywhere between two to maybe four weeks in an enterprise like Northwestern

**[12:33]** weeks in an enterprise like Northwestern

**[12:33]** weeks in an enterprise like Northwestern Mutual just finding what data exists and

**[12:35]** Mutual just finding what data exists and

**[12:35]** Mutual just finding what data exists and who owns it so I can start talk uh the

**[12:37]** who owns it so I can start talk uh the

**[12:37]** who owns it so I can start talk uh the conversation with them.

**[12:39]** conversation with them.

**[12:39]** conversation with them. Um and the next layer was really about

**[12:42]** Um and the next layer was really about

**[12:42]** Um and the next layer was really about pulling in information and trying to do

**[12:44]** pulling in information and trying to do

**[12:44]** pulling in information and trying to do some light pivoting around the data. Um

**[12:47]** some light pivoting around the data. Um

**[12:47]** some light pivoting around the data. Um each one of these steps as you can see

**[12:50]** each one of these steps as you can see

**[12:50]** each one of these steps as you can see also created an input to the to the

**[12:52]** also created an input to the to the

**[12:52]** also created an input to the to the following step so that the research

**[12:55]** following step so that the research

**[12:55]** following step so that the research itself was kind of self u

**[12:57]** itself was kind of self u

**[12:57]** itself was kind of self u self-propelling and there were

**[12:59]** self-propelling and there were

**[12:59]** self-propelling and there were incremental outcomes coming out of each


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** incremental outcomes coming out of each

**[13:00]** incremental outcomes coming out of each one of these phases. Uh the next one is

**[13:03]** one of these phases. Uh the next one is

**[13:03]** one of these phases. Uh the next one is more kind of setting it up for

**[13:05]** more kind of setting it up for

**[13:05]** more kind of setting it up for enterprise level usage. So understanding

**[13:07]** enterprise level usage. So understanding

**[13:07]** enterprise level usage. So understanding roles of in uh of different users coming

**[13:10]** roles of in uh of different users coming

**[13:10]** roles of in uh of different users coming in what they may be asking about what

**[13:12]** in what they may be asking about what

**[13:12]** in what they may be asking about what type of access we want to give them etc

**[13:14]** type of access we want to give them etc

**[13:14]** type of access we want to give them etc and eventually and this is still some

**[13:17]** and eventually and this is still some

**[13:17]** and eventually and this is still some ways to go ahead uh building kind of a

**[13:19]** ways to go ahead uh building kind of a

**[13:19]** ways to go ahead uh building kind of a fullyfledged NBI agent which doesn't

**[13:21]** fullyfledged NBI agent which doesn't

**[13:21]** fullyfledged NBI agent which doesn't only quote information from existing

**[13:23]** only quote information from existing

**[13:23]** only quote information from existing reports but I can actually run SQL

**[13:26]** reports but I can actually run SQL

**[13:26]** reports but I can actually run SQL queries on its own uh pull in more data

**[13:29]** queries on its own uh pull in more data

**[13:29]** queries on its own uh pull in more data do more sophisticated joints between

**[13:31]** do more sophisticated joints between

**[13:31]** do more sophisticated joints between different data so it can answer more

**[13:32]** different data so it can answer more

**[13:32]** different data so it can answer more complex questions so that's the road map

**[13:35]** complex questions so that's the road map

**[13:35]** complex questions so that's the road map right that's kind the high level plan.

**[13:37]** right that's kind the high level plan.

**[13:37]** right that's kind the high level plan. Now, why did that work? Well, kind of

**[13:39]** Now, why did that work? Well, kind of

**[13:39]** Now, why did that work? Well, kind of quickly summarize them. We talked about

**[13:41]** quickly summarize them. We talked about

**[13:41]** quickly summarize them. We talked about uh so we get value uh early and we get

**[13:44]** uh so we get value uh early and we get

**[13:44]** uh so we get value uh early and we get value often. Each one of this was a six

**[13:46]** value often. Each one of this was a six

**[13:46]** value often. Each one of this was a six week sprint at the end of which we had

**[13:49]** week sprint at the end of which we had

**[13:49]** week sprint at the end of which we had had a very tangible deliverable coming

**[13:52]** had a very tangible deliverable coming

**[13:52]** had a very tangible deliverable coming back to the business that we could

**[13:53]** back to the business that we could

**[13:53]** back to the business that we could decide to productize. Uh and at any

**[13:56]** decide to productize. Uh and at any

**[13:56]** decide to productize. Uh and at any point in time, we could decide how we

**[13:59]** point in time, we could decide how we

**[13:59]** point in time, we could decide how we want to move forward. There was


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** want to move forward. There was

**[14:00]** want to move forward. There was transparent progress. There was

**[14:01]** transparent progress. There was

**[14:02]** transparent progress. There was incremental business value. Uh each one

**[14:04]** incremental business value. Uh each one

**[14:04]** incremental business value. Uh each one of these steps allowed us to learn

**[14:06]** of these steps allowed us to learn

**[14:06]** of these steps allowed us to learn something that helped feed the next

**[14:08]** something that helped feed the next

**[14:08]** something that helped feed the next step.

**[14:09]** step.

**[14:09]** step. And maybe the most important part and

**[14:11]** And maybe the most important part and

**[14:11]** And maybe the most important part and that's the bottom line here and that's

**[14:13]** that's the bottom line here and that's

**[14:13]** that's the bottom line here and that's the part that executives really look at.

**[14:16]** the part that executives really look at.

**[14:16]** the part that executives really look at. How do we control the risk in continuing

**[14:18]** How do we control the risk in continuing

**[14:18]** How do we control the risk in continuing to invest in this type of research

**[14:20]** to invest in this type of research

**[14:20]** to invest in this type of research project and this is really about

**[14:23]** project and this is really about

**[14:23]** project and this is really about eliminating things like sun cost bias,

**[14:25]** eliminating things like sun cost bias,

**[14:25]** eliminating things like sun cost bias, right? We already paid you know you know

**[14:27]** right? We already paid you know you know

**[14:27]** right? We already paid you know you know whatever a million dollar. Let's just

**[14:28]** whatever a million dollar. Let's just

**[14:28]** whatever a million dollar. Let's just get through the project see what we get

**[14:30]** get through the project see what we get

**[14:30]** get through the project see what we get at the end. This eliminates the uh uh

**[14:33]** at the end. This eliminates the uh uh

**[14:33]** at the end. This eliminates the uh uh fear of of competitors coming in and

**[14:35]** fear of of competitors coming in and

**[14:35]** fear of of competitors coming in and maybe we don't need to continue

**[14:37]** maybe we don't need to continue

**[14:37]** maybe we don't need to continue investing in this right so everyone in

**[14:39]** investing in this right so everyone in

**[14:39]** investing in this right so everyone in the industry is researching GenBI and

**[14:41]** the industry is researching GenBI and

**[14:41]** the industry is researching GenBI and there are solutions like data bricks

**[14:43]** there are solutions like data bricks

**[14:43]** there are solutions like data bricks genie that are coming up and they're

**[14:44]** genie that are coming up and they're

**[14:44]** genie that are coming up and they're getting better and better maybe at some

**[14:46]** getting better and better maybe at some

**[14:46]** getting better and better maybe at some point in time it's better for us as an

**[14:47]** point in time it's better for us as an

**[14:47]** point in time it's better for us as an organization to actually adopt data

**[14:49]** organization to actually adopt data

**[14:49]** organization to actually adopt data bricks genie but at that point again

**[14:52]** bricks genie but at that point again

**[14:52]** bricks genie but at that point again first it's much easier for us to pull

**[14:53]** first it's much easier for us to pull

**[14:54]** first it's much easier for us to pull the plug and the funding but we already

**[14:56]** the plug and the funding but we already

**[14:56]** the plug and the funding but we already have a good understanding of what good

**[14:59]** have a good understanding of what good

**[14:59]** have a good understanding of what good looks like we have benchmarks that we


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** looks like we have benchmarks that we

**[15:00]** looks like we have benchmarks that we used for ourselves when testing our own

**[15:02]** used for ourselves when testing our own

**[15:02]** used for ourselves when testing our own system that we can test a third party

**[15:04]** system that we can test a third party

**[15:04]** system that we can test a third party solution with. And we know what to

**[15:07]** solution with. And we know what to

**[15:07]** solution with. And we know what to expect, right? We know what works, we

**[15:09]** expect, right? We know what works, we

**[15:09]** expect, right? We know what works, we know what doesn't. We know what a kind

**[15:11]** know what doesn't. We know what a kind

**[15:11]** know what doesn't. We know what a kind of fluffy demo from a vendor would look

**[15:13]** of fluffy demo from a vendor would look

**[15:13]** of fluffy demo from a vendor would look like. And we know where to drill in to

**[15:15]** like. And we know where to drill in to

**[15:15]** like. And we know where to drill in to ask the tough questions.

**[15:20]** So let's see kind of what it looks like

**[15:20]** So let's see kind of what it looks like under the hood and how we productize

**[15:23]** under the hood and how we productize

**[15:23]** under the hood and how we productize different elements uh of this

**[15:24]** different elements uh of this

**[15:24]** different elements uh of this architecture. Uh and maybe kind of very

**[15:26]** architecture. Uh and maybe kind of very

**[15:26]** architecture. Uh and maybe kind of very quickly, why can't we just do it with uh

**[15:28]** quickly, why can't we just do it with uh

**[15:28]** quickly, why can't we just do it with uh chat GPT? So you [snorts] know just

**[15:30]** chat GPT? So you [snorts] know just

**[15:30]** chat GPT? So you [snorts] know just dumping a schema into chachpp doesn't

**[15:32]** dumping a schema into chachpp doesn't

**[15:32]** dumping a schema into chachpp doesn't work. Usually schemas are very messy.

**[15:34]** work. Usually schemas are very messy.

**[15:34]** work. Usually schemas are very messy. It's not uh easy to understand the

**[15:36]** It's not uh easy to understand the

**[15:36]** It's not uh easy to understand the context and the meaning of things.

**[15:38]** context and the meaning of things.

**[15:38]** context and the meaning of things. [snorts] Uh and eventually governance is

**[15:40]** [snorts] Uh and eventually governance is

**[15:40]** [snorts] Uh and eventually governance is super important. So there was a lot of

**[15:41]** super important. So there was a lot of

**[15:41]** super important. So there was a lot of governance built into the architecture

**[15:43]** governance built into the architecture

**[15:43]** governance built into the architecture that was very hard to apply on chpd from

**[15:46]** that was very hard to apply on chpd from

**[15:46]** that was very hard to apply on chpd from the outside but even solutions like you

**[15:48]** the outside but even solutions like you

**[15:48]** the outside but even solutions like you know data bricks genius third party much

**[15:50]** know data bricks genius third party much

**[15:50]** know data bricks genius third party much harder to govern from the outside than

**[15:51]** harder to govern from the outside than

**[15:52]** harder to govern from the outside than from the inside. But still TBD.

**[15:55]** from the inside. But still TBD.

**[15:55]** from the inside. But still TBD. Uh so the stack kind of looks like this.

**[15:57]** Uh so the stack kind of looks like this.

**[15:57]** Uh so the stack kind of looks like this. Uh we have a data and metadata layer


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:00]** Uh we have a data and metadata layer

**[16:00]** Uh we have a data and metadata layer that we produced. We have four different

**[16:01]** that we produced. We have four different

**[16:01]** that we produced. We have four different agents that are running across the

**[16:03]** agents that are running across the

**[16:03]** agents that are running across the pipeline. A metadata agent that

**[16:05]** pipeline. A metadata agent that

**[16:06]** pipeline. A metadata agent that understands the context. A rag agent

**[16:07]** understands the context. A rag agent

**[16:07]** understands the context. A rag agent that finds the different reports. An SQL

**[16:10]** that finds the different reports. An SQL

**[16:10]** that finds the different reports. An SQL agent that can pull more data if we need

**[16:12]** agent that can pull more data if we need

**[16:12]** agent that can pull more data if we need that. And then eventually what we call a

**[16:13]** that. And then eventually what we call a

**[16:14]** that. And then eventually what we call a BI agent that takes all that information

**[16:15]** BI agent that takes all that information

**[16:15]** BI agent that takes all that information and delivers an answer to the question

**[16:17]** and delivers an answer to the question

**[16:17]** and delivers an answer to the question that was asked. On top of that, we slap

**[16:20]** that was asked. On top of that, we slap

**[16:20]** that was asked. On top of that, we slap governance and trust and orchestration

**[16:22]** governance and trust and orchestration

**[16:22]** governance and trust and orchestration and eventually some kind of a contextual

**[16:24]** and eventually some kind of a contextual

**[16:24]** and eventually some kind of a contextual UI. Um and this is how the flow goes. So

**[16:29]** UI. Um and this is how the flow goes. So

**[16:29]** UI. Um and this is how the flow goes. So when a business question comes in we uh

**[16:32]** when a business question comes in we uh

**[16:32]** when a business question comes in we uh push it into the orchestrator and

**[16:34]** push it into the orchestrator and

**[16:34]** push it into the orchestrator and basically decides how to facilitate the

**[16:36]** basically decides how to facilitate the

**[16:36]** basically decides how to facilitate the process. The first thing that we do is

**[16:38]** process. The first thing that we do is

**[16:38]** process. The first thing that we do is understanding the context. So that's

**[16:40]** understanding the context. So that's

**[16:40]** understanding the context. So that's where that metadata agent comes in works

**[16:42]** where that metadata agent comes in works

**[16:42]** where that metadata agent comes in works with the catalog works with all the

**[16:43]** with the catalog works with all the

**[16:44]** with the catalog works with all the documentation that we have across the

**[16:45]** documentation that we have across the

**[16:45]** documentation that we have across the system to understand what we're being

**[16:47]** system to understand what we're being

**[16:47]** system to understand what we're being asked about and what's the relevant

**[16:49]** asked about and what's the relevant

**[16:49]** asked about and what's the relevant information to share. Then we go to the

**[16:51]** information to share. Then we go to the

**[16:51]** information to share. Then we go to the rag agent which tries to find an

**[16:53]** rag agent which tries to find an

**[16:53]** rag agent which tries to find an existing report again out of a list of

**[16:55]** existing report again out of a list of

**[16:55]** existing report again out of a list of certified reports that we know are

**[16:58]** certified reports that we know are

**[16:58]** certified reports that we know are allowed for people to use and people

**[16:59]** allowed for people to use and people

**[16:59]** allowed for people to use and people have spent a lot of time fine-tuning


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:01]** have spent a lot of time fine-tuning

**[17:01]** have spent a lot of time fine-tuning them and making them as accurate as

**[17:03]** them and making them as accurate as

**[17:03]** them and making them as accurate as possible.

**[17:04]** possible.

**[17:04]** possible. If we can't find the report or if it's

**[17:07]** If we can't find the report or if it's

**[17:07]** If we can't find the report or if it's not exactly what we need to um to use,

**[17:09]** not exactly what we need to um to use,

**[17:09]** not exactly what we need to um to use, that's where we go to the SQL agent that

**[17:12]** that's where we go to the SQL agent that

**[17:12]** that's where we go to the SQL agent that basically tries to create a more um

**[17:15]** basically tries to create a more um

**[17:15]** basically tries to create a more um exact query or a more elaborate query.

**[17:18]** exact query or a more elaborate query.

**[17:18]** exact query or a more elaborate query. And even if the report that we have is

**[17:21]** And even if the report that we have is

**[17:21]** And even if the report that we have is not usable as is, it gives us that

**[17:24]** not usable as is, it gives us that

**[17:24]** not usable as is, it gives us that initial seed of a query that we can then

**[17:26]** initial seed of a query that we can then

**[17:26]** initial seed of a query that we can then expand on rather than having to build

**[17:28]** expand on rather than having to build

**[17:28]** expand on rather than having to build one from scratch. So it's kind of like a

**[17:31]** one from scratch. So it's kind of like a

**[17:31]** one from scratch. So it's kind of like a fewot uh example, but in this case the

**[17:35]** fewot uh example, but in this case the

**[17:35]** fewot uh example, but in this case the example that we give is very very close

**[17:37]** example that we give is very very close

**[17:37]** example that we give is very very close to the actual result that we're

**[17:39]** to the actual result that we're

**[17:39]** to the actual result that we're expecting to get. We then execute it

**[17:42]** expecting to get. We then execute it

**[17:42]** expecting to get. We then execute it against the database pull and push it

**[17:43]** against the database pull and push it

**[17:43]** against the database pull and push it into the BI agent which gen with which

**[17:46]** into the BI agent which gen with which

**[17:46]** into the BI agent which gen with which gen uh translate that to a business

**[17:49]** gen uh translate that to a business

**[17:49]** gen uh translate that to a business answer and not just dumping data back on

**[17:52]** answer and not just dumping data back on

**[17:52]** answer and not just dumping data back on the user and this is what goes into the

**[17:55]** the user and this is what goes into the

**[17:55]** the user and this is what goes into the final answer. Now there's obviously some

**[17:56]** final answer. Now there's obviously some

**[17:56]** final answer. Now there's obviously some kind of a loop that says if I'm in the

**[17:58]** kind of a loop that says if I'm in the

**[17:58]** kind of a loop that says if I'm in the same conversation I'm probably talking


### [18:00 - 19:00]

**[18:00]** same conversation I'm probably talking

**[18:00]** same conversation I'm probably talking about the same data so we don't have to

**[18:02]** about the same data so we don't have to

**[18:02]** about the same data so we don't have to talk about this or do this again and

**[18:03]** talk about this or do this again and

**[18:03]** talk about this or do this again and again. Now

**[18:06]** again. Now

**[18:06]** again. Now each one of these three components, each

**[18:07]** each one of these three components, each

**[18:07]** each one of these three components, each one of these three agents can be

**[18:09]** one of these three agents can be

**[18:09]** one of these three agents can be packaged as its own product and

**[18:13]** packaged as its own product and

**[18:13]** packaged as its own product and delivered to production with a very

**[18:16]** delivered to production with a very

**[18:16]** delivered to production with a very tangible and actual impact on business

**[18:19]** tangible and actual impact on business

**[18:19]** tangible and actual impact on business metrics. Okay. And that's the kind of

**[18:22]** metrics. Okay. And that's the kind of

**[18:22]** metrics. Okay. And that's the kind of beauty of this uh approach that after we

**[18:26]** beauty of this uh approach that after we

**[18:26]** beauty of this uh approach that after we productize each one of these, we could

**[18:28]** productize each one of these, we could

**[18:28]** productize each one of these, we could have basically said stop or let's move

**[18:30]** have basically said stop or let's move

**[18:30]** have basically said stop or let's move forward.

**[18:32]** forward.

**[18:32]** forward. uh and just some giving bottom line

**[18:34]** uh and just some giving bottom line

**[18:34]** uh and just some giving bottom line numbers around some of these. So just

**[18:36]** numbers around some of these. So just

**[18:36]** numbers around some of these. So just the rag agent that pulls the right

**[18:39]** the rag agent that pulls the right

**[18:39]** the rag agent that pulls the right report uh allowed us to take about 20%

**[18:43]** report uh allowed us to take about 20%

**[18:43]** report uh allowed us to take about 20% of the overall capacity of the BI team

**[18:46]** of the overall capacity of the BI team

**[18:46]** of the overall capacity of the BI team that basically said uh all we do is just

**[18:50]** that basically said uh all we do is just

**[18:50]** that basically said uh all we do is just share the right report with the right

**[18:51]** share the right report with the right

**[18:51]** share the right report with the right person. So we were able to automate

**[18:53]** person. So we were able to automate

**[18:53]** person. So we were able to automate around 80% out of those uh 20% and we're

**[18:56]** around 80% out of those uh 20% and we're

**[18:56]** around 80% out of those uh 20% and we're talking about a team of 10 people. So


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:00]** talking about a team of 10 people. So

**[19:00]** talking about a team of 10 people. So roughly two people full-time job all

**[19:03]** roughly two people full-time job all

**[19:03]** roughly two people full-time job all they do is find the right report and

**[19:05]** they do is find the right report and

**[19:05]** they do is find the right report and send it to the right person.

**[19:08]** send it to the right person.

**[19:08]** send it to the right person. uh the metadata understandings that we

**[19:10]** uh the metadata understandings that we

**[19:10]** uh the metadata understandings that we got from learning how to interact with

**[19:12]** got from learning how to interact with

**[19:12]** got from learning how to interact with the data through an LLM allowed us to

**[19:14]** the data through an LLM allowed us to

**[19:14]** the data through an LLM allowed us to run AB test in a in the semantic layer

**[19:17]** run AB test in a in the semantic layer

**[19:17]** run AB test in a in the semantic layer project that we did and that allowed us

**[19:19]** project that we did and that allowed us

**[19:19]** project that we did and that allowed us to prove back again to the senior

**[19:23]** to prove back again to the senior

**[19:23]** to prove back again to the senior leadership in the company that there is

**[19:25]** leadership in the company that there is

**[19:25]** leadership in the company that there is value and tangible value measurable

**[19:28]** value and tangible value measurable

**[19:28]** value and tangible value measurable value in enriching metadata. And we did

**[19:31]** value in enriching metadata. And we did

**[19:31]** value in enriching metadata. And we did that basically by running uh a a battery

**[19:34]** that basically by running uh a a battery

**[19:34]** that basically by running uh a a battery of questions um against a database that

**[19:37]** of questions um against a database that

**[19:37]** of questions um against a database that had good metadata and one that didn't

**[19:39]** had good metadata and one that didn't

**[19:39]** had good metadata and one that didn't have good metadata. And we show how much

**[19:42]** have good metadata. And we show how much

**[19:42]** have good metadata. And we show how much better an LLM performs when having the

**[19:44]** better an LLM performs when having the

**[19:44]** better an LLM performs when having the right metadata in place. So basically

**[19:46]** right metadata in place. So basically

**[19:46]** right metadata in place. So basically proving the value of something that can

**[19:48]** proving the value of something that can

**[19:48]** proving the value of something that can be very fluffy like hey let's bring in

**[19:50]** be very fluffy like hey let's bring in

**[19:50]** be very fluffy like hey let's bring in more documentation into the code. Uh

**[19:53]** more documentation into the code. Uh

**[19:53]** more documentation into the code. Uh right now we're experimenting with the

**[19:55]** right now we're experimenting with the

**[19:55]** right now we're experimenting with the data pivoting bot. Uh so once you have a

**[19:58]** data pivoting bot. Uh so once you have a

**[19:58]** data pivoting bot. Uh so once you have a dashboard or a report be able to change


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:01]** dashboard or a report be able to change

**[20:01]** dashboard or a report be able to change the time horizon some of the views some

**[20:03]** the time horizon some of the views some

**[20:03]** the time horizon some of the views some of the segmentations and the groupings

**[20:04]** of the segmentations and the groupings

**[20:04]** of the segmentations and the groupings of the data again kind of real time

**[20:06]** of the data again kind of real time

**[20:06]** of the data again kind of real time without having a person do that for uh a

**[20:10]** without having a person do that for uh a

**[20:10]** without having a person do that for uh a business stakeholder and some of the

**[20:12]** business stakeholder and some of the

**[20:12]** business stakeholder and some of the next steps is really evaluating the

**[20:13]** next steps is really evaluating the

**[20:13]** next steps is really evaluating the tools that are out there for uh Genbi

**[20:16]** tools that are out there for uh Genbi

**[20:16]** tools that are out there for uh Genbi like data bricks genie for example and

**[20:18]** like data bricks genie for example and

**[20:18]** like data bricks genie for example and we're going to go into a much more

**[20:19]** we're going to go into a much more

**[20:20]** we're going to go into a much more rigorous process of enriching our

**[20:21]** rigorous process of enriching our

**[20:21]** rigorous process of enriching our catalog with metadata and documentation

**[20:24]** catalog with metadata and documentation

**[20:24]** catalog with metadata and documentation and that's also going to come out of a

**[20:26]** and that's also going to come out of a

**[20:26]** and that's also going to come out of a lot of the learnings that we got from uh

**[20:28]** lot of the learnings that we got from uh

**[20:28]** lot of the learnings that we got from uh the research that we've done. So even if

**[20:30]** the research that we've done. So even if

**[20:30]** the research that we've done. So even if we don't end up writing a GenBI agent

**[20:34]** we don't end up writing a GenBI agent

**[20:34]** we don't end up writing a GenBI agent full-fledged end to end, we already got

**[20:37]** full-fledged end to end, we already got

**[20:37]** full-fledged end to end, we already got a lot of value back from this and this

**[20:39]** a lot of value back from this and this

**[20:39]** a lot of value back from this and this is really what allowed our senior

**[20:41]** is really what allowed our senior

**[20:41]** is really what allowed our senior leadership team to continuously invest

**[20:43]** leadership team to continuously invest

**[20:43]** leadership team to continuously invest in this project quarter over quarter.

**[20:47]** in this project quarter over quarter.

**[20:47]** in this project quarter over quarter. One thing that I want to wrap up with is

**[20:50]** One thing that I want to wrap up with is

**[20:50]** One thing that I want to wrap up with is just a couple of thoughts I had about

**[20:51]** just a couple of thoughts I had about

**[20:52]** just a couple of thoughts I had about the future. So um I think we talk a lot

**[20:55]** the future. So um I think we talk a lot

**[20:55]** the future. So um I think we talk a lot about how to prepare data. I think

**[20:57]** about how to prepare data. I think

**[20:57]** about how to prepare data. I think that's going to be a huge area in the

**[20:58]** that's going to be a huge area in the

**[20:58]** that's going to be a huge area in the market and they're going to be probably
