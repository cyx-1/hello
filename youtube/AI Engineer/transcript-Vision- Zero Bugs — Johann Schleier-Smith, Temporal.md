**[00:02]** Please join me in envisioning a world

**[00:02]** Please join me in envisioning a world where software has zero bugs. Not just a

**[00:05]** where software has zero bugs. Not just a

**[00:05]** where software has zero bugs. Not just a few bugs, but actually literally zero

**[00:08]** few bugs, but actually literally zero

**[00:08]** few bugs, but actually literally zero bugs. Okay. Okay. Just bear with me now.

**[00:12]** bugs. Okay. Okay. Just bear with me now.

**[00:12]** bugs. Okay. Okay. Just bear with me now. So for most people, let's just say

**[00:16]** So for most people, let's just say

**[00:16]** So for most people, let's just say people who aren't software engineers,

**[00:19]** people who aren't software engineers,

**[00:19]** people who aren't software engineers, bugs are actually just not a very big

**[00:21]** bugs are actually just not a very big

**[00:21]** bugs are actually just not a very big part of their life. Period. Most of the

**[00:24]** part of their life. Period. Most of the

**[00:24]** part of their life. Period. Most of the apps that we use on our phones, our

**[00:27]** apps that we use on our phones, our

**[00:27]** apps that we use on our phones, our social media, our news, that stuff

**[00:30]** social media, our news, that stuff

**[00:30]** social media, our news, that stuff pretty much works most of the time. The

**[00:32]** pretty much works most of the time. The

**[00:32]** pretty much works most of the time. The camera works most of the time. Any of

**[00:34]** camera works most of the time. Any of

**[00:34]** camera works most of the time. Any of those most popular apps, banking, they

**[00:37]** those most popular apps, banking, they

**[00:37]** those most popular apps, banking, they work really well most of the time. So,

**[00:40]** work really well most of the time. So,

**[00:40]** work really well most of the time. So, bugs are really not top of mind for most

**[00:43]** bugs are really not top of mind for most

**[00:43]** bugs are really not top of mind for most people.

**[00:45]** people.

**[00:45]** people. Now, anybody who makes software

**[00:48]** Now, anybody who makes software

**[00:48]** Now, anybody who makes software is very familiar with a different world.

**[00:52]** is very familiar with a different world.

**[00:52]** is very familiar with a different world. A world of constant stress about the

**[00:57]** A world of constant stress about the

**[00:57]** A world of constant stress about the possibility of software errors creeping


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** possibility of software errors creeping

**[01:00]** possibility of software errors creeping into critical applications

**[01:03]** into critical applications

**[01:03]** into critical applications on call uh responses to pagers, cloud

**[01:07]** on call uh responses to pagers, cloud

**[01:07]** on call uh responses to pagers, cloud provider outages, the list goes on and

**[01:10]** provider outages, the list goes on and

**[01:10]** provider outages, the list goes on and on. So there's a disconnect between what

**[01:14]** on. So there's a disconnect between what

**[01:14]** on. So there's a disconnect between what most people are experiencing every day

**[01:16]** most people are experiencing every day

**[01:16]** most people are experiencing every day in the world and the reality of making

**[01:19]** in the world and the reality of making

**[01:20]** in the world and the reality of making software. Now I will say that even for

**[01:25]** software. Now I will say that even for

**[01:25]** software. Now I will say that even for those of us who are not engineers,

**[01:29]** those of us who are not engineers,

**[01:29]** those of us who are not engineers, the perils of broken software do crop up

**[01:33]** the perils of broken software do crop up

**[01:33]** the perils of broken software do crop up from time to time.

**[01:35]** from time to time.

**[01:35]** from time to time. Just yesterday, I took my seven-year-old

**[01:39]** Just yesterday, I took my seven-year-old

**[01:39]** Just yesterday, I took my seven-year-old son to the mini golf place, and there

**[01:42]** son to the mini golf place, and there

**[01:42]** son to the mini golf place, and there was just one reservation left.

**[01:45]** was just one reservation left.

**[01:45]** was just one reservation left. reservations were required.

**[01:48]** reservations were required.

**[01:48]** reservations were required. And I dutifully whipped out my

**[01:51]** And I dutifully whipped out my

**[01:51]** And I dutifully whipped out my smartphone,

**[01:53]** smartphone,

**[01:53]** smartphone, snapped the QR code, went through the

**[01:55]** snapped the QR code, went through the

**[01:55]** snapped the QR code, went through the process to grab the last reservation

**[01:58]** process to grab the last reservation

**[01:58]** process to grab the last reservation spot, only to be told that it had been


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:03]** spot, only to be told that it had been

**[02:03]** spot, only to be told that it had been grabbed by somebody else.

**[02:10]** Well, I got to say I was very proud of

**[02:10]** Well, I got to say I was very proud of my son because most kids most of the

**[02:12]** my son because most kids most of the

**[02:12]** my son because most kids most of the time would have probably melted and he

**[02:15]** time would have probably melted and he

**[02:15]** time would have probably melted and he actually didn't. He handled it great.

**[02:17]** actually didn't. He handled it great.

**[02:17]** actually didn't. He handled it great. And then can you imagine my surprise

**[02:20]** And then can you imagine my surprise

**[02:20]** And then can you imagine my surprise when I checked my messages about 10

**[02:22]** when I checked my messages about 10

**[02:22]** when I checked my messages about 10 minutes later to find out that in fact

**[02:27]** minutes later to find out that in fact

**[02:27]** minutes later to find out that in fact that last reservation slot had gone to

**[02:30]** that last reservation slot had gone to

**[02:30]** that last reservation slot had gone to us. So we were thrilled. That roller

**[02:34]** us. So we were thrilled. That roller

**[02:34]** us. So we were thrilled. That roller coaster journey still reinforces the

**[02:36]** coaster journey still reinforces the

**[02:36]** coaster journey still reinforces the fact that bugs are real in the world and

**[02:39]** fact that bugs are real in the world and

**[02:39]** fact that bugs are real in the world and they have real impact on real people

**[02:41]** they have real impact on real people

**[02:41]** they have real impact on real people every day. Even if it is just a

**[02:43]** every day. Even if it is just a

**[02:43]** every day. Even if it is just a momentary emotional swing for a

**[02:46]** momentary emotional swing for a

**[02:46]** momentary emotional swing for a seven-year-old.

**[02:48]** seven-year-old.

**[02:48]** seven-year-old. I'm Johan Flyersmith and today I'm going

**[02:51]** I'm Johan Flyersmith and today I'm going

**[02:51]** I'm Johan Flyersmith and today I'm going to be talking to you about a vision of

**[02:53]** to be talking to you about a vision of

**[02:53]** to be talking to you about a vision of zero bugs. Now I work at Temporal

**[02:57]** zero bugs. Now I work at Temporal

**[02:57]** zero bugs. Now I work at Temporal Technologies. Temporal makes software

**[02:59]** Technologies. Temporal makes software

**[02:59]** Technologies. Temporal makes software for durable execution. and it makes


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** for durable execution. and it makes

**[03:01]** for durable execution. and it makes software that deployed to the cloud do

**[03:03]** software that deployed to the cloud do

**[03:03]** software that deployed to the cloud do what it's supposed to do. But this talk

**[03:05]** what it's supposed to do. But this talk

**[03:05]** what it's supposed to do. But this talk is not going to be about temporal. There

**[03:09]** is not going to be about temporal. There

**[03:09]** is not going to be about temporal. There are several other talks at the AI

**[03:11]** are several other talks at the AI

**[03:11]** are several other talks at the AI engineer summit that do talk about

**[03:13]** engineer summit that do talk about

**[03:14]** engineer summit that do talk about temporal. My colleague Cornelia Davis

**[03:16]** temporal. My colleague Cornelia Davis

**[03:16]** temporal. My colleague Cornelia Davis will be doing a workshop on Sunday. In

**[03:19]** will be doing a workshop on Sunday. In

**[03:19]** will be doing a workshop on Sunday. In addition, Samuel Kovven from Pyantic

**[03:21]** addition, Samuel Kovven from Pyantic

**[03:21]** addition, Samuel Kovven from Pyantic will be talking about building agents

**[03:25]** will be talking about building agents

**[03:25]** will be talking about building agents that combine Temporal with Pideantic.

**[03:28]** that combine Temporal with Pideantic.

**[03:28]** that combine Temporal with Pideantic. The push to build reliable software and

**[03:32]** The push to build reliable software and

**[03:32]** The push to build reliable software and the vision of giving engineers time back

**[03:35]** the vision of giving engineers time back

**[03:35]** the vision of giving engineers time back for innovation is tightly lined with our

**[03:38]** for innovation is tightly lined with our

**[03:38]** for innovation is tightly lined with our products at Temporal. However,

**[03:40]** products at Temporal. However,

**[03:40]** products at Temporal. However, everything in this presentation is going

**[03:42]** everything in this presentation is going

**[03:42]** everything in this presentation is going to be outside of the scope of our

**[03:44]** to be outside of the scope of our

**[03:44]** to be outside of the scope of our current products. Let's return to the

**[03:46]** current products. Let's return to the

**[03:46]** current products. Let's return to the vision of zero bugs.

**[03:49]** vision of zero bugs.

**[03:49]** vision of zero bugs. There are quite a few objections, really

**[03:51]** There are quite a few objections, really

**[03:51]** There are quite a few objections, really reasonable objections to this vision.

**[03:55]** reasonable objections to this vision.

**[03:55]** reasonable objections to this vision. So, let's talk through them. First of

**[03:57]** So, let's talk through them. First of

**[03:57]** So, let's talk through them. First of all, as we've started out saying,


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** all, as we've started out saying,

**[04:01]** all, as we've started out saying, incidents happen. Incidents happen

**[04:03]** incidents happen. Incidents happen

**[04:03]** incidents happen. Incidents happen whether it's because of cloud outages or

**[04:06]** whether it's because of cloud outages or

**[04:06]** whether it's because of cloud outages or problems with orders. They happen and

**[04:09]** problems with orders. They happen and

**[04:09]** problems with orders. They happen and generally speaking, we pick ourselves up

**[04:11]** generally speaking, we pick ourselves up

**[04:11]** generally speaking, we pick ourselves up and get through them. More broadly, the

**[04:13]** and get through them. More broadly, the

**[04:13]** and get through them. More broadly, the world is imperfect and so a few software

**[04:16]** world is imperfect and so a few software

**[04:16]** world is imperfect and so a few software bugs here and there might be okay. And

**[04:19]** bugs here and there might be okay. And

**[04:19]** bugs here and there might be okay. And in fact, we already are solving for

**[04:22]** in fact, we already are solving for

**[04:22]** in fact, we already are solving for reliability pretty well in many of the

**[04:25]** reliability pretty well in many of the

**[04:25]** reliability pretty well in many of the situations where it matters. So maybe

**[04:28]** situations where it matters. So maybe

**[04:28]** situations where it matters. So maybe software is good enough. Maybe we don't

**[04:31]** software is good enough. Maybe we don't

**[04:31]** software is good enough. Maybe we don't need to push towards a vision of zero

**[04:33]** need to push towards a vision of zero

**[04:33]** need to push towards a vision of zero bugs.

**[04:35]** bugs.

**[04:35]** bugs. Here's another objection. You could give

**[04:38]** Here's another objection. You could give

**[04:38]** Here's another objection. You could give perhaps good reasons, good theoretical

**[04:40]** perhaps good reasons, good theoretical

**[04:40]** perhaps good reasons, good theoretical reasons even why eliminating all of the

**[04:43]** reasons even why eliminating all of the

**[04:43]** reasons even why eliminating all of the bugs is just simply impossible. Why?

**[04:45]** bugs is just simply impossible. Why?

**[04:45]** bugs is just simply impossible. Why? It's a preposterous idea. So you could

**[04:48]** It's a preposterous idea. So you could

**[04:48]** It's a preposterous idea. So you could say there are millions of lines of code.

**[04:50]** say there are millions of lines of code.

**[04:50]** say there are millions of lines of code. The code is just too big. We have too

**[04:52]** The code is just too big. We have too

**[04:52]** The code is just too big. We have too much code as we know as agents generate

**[04:55]** much code as we know as agents generate

**[04:55]** much code as we know as agents generate more and more code that exacerbates the

**[04:58]** more and more code that exacerbates the

**[04:58]** more and more code that exacerbates the problem and it's all just simply too


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** problem and it's all just simply too

**[05:00]** problem and it's all just simply too complicated.

**[05:02]** complicated.

**[05:02]** complicated. Furthermore, if we look at the

**[05:04]** Furthermore, if we look at the

**[05:04]** Furthermore, if we look at the definition of a bug, it seems that the

**[05:07]** definition of a bug, it seems that the

**[05:07]** definition of a bug, it seems that the specifications unavoidably have some

**[05:09]** specifications unavoidably have some

**[05:10]** specifications unavoidably have some degree of ambiguity. I would say that

**[05:12]** degree of ambiguity. I would say that

**[05:12]** degree of ambiguity. I would say that it's a bug. Whatever the way the program

**[05:14]** it's a bug. Whatever the way the program

**[05:14]** it's a bug. Whatever the way the program works

**[05:16]** works

**[05:16]** works does not match the end user's

**[05:18]** does not match the end user's

**[05:18]** does not match the end user's expectations.

**[05:20]** expectations.

**[05:20]** expectations. They don't care whether it was a problem

**[05:22]** They don't care whether it was a problem

**[05:22]** They don't care whether it was a problem with a product specification or whether

**[05:24]** with a product specification or whether

**[05:24]** with a product specification or whether the programmer forgot to check for a

**[05:27]** the programmer forgot to check for a

**[05:27]** the programmer forgot to check for a null. It just doesn't matter, right? And

**[05:30]** null. It just doesn't matter, right? And

**[05:30]** null. It just doesn't matter, right? And furthermore, unexpected things happen in

**[05:32]** furthermore, unexpected things happen in

**[05:32]** furthermore, unexpected things happen in the real world. If we think about

**[05:34]** the real world. If we think about

**[05:34]** the real world. If we think about control systems for example, if there is

**[05:38]** control systems for example, if there is

**[05:38]** control systems for example, if there is some aspect of the world that hasn't

**[05:40]** some aspect of the world that hasn't

**[05:40]** some aspect of the world that hasn't been modeled correctly, you could see

**[05:43]** been modeled correctly, you could see

**[05:43]** been modeled correctly, you could see this frequently for example in the fears

**[05:46]** this frequently for example in the fears

**[05:46]** this frequently for example in the fears around the capabilities of self-driving

**[05:48]** around the capabilities of self-driving

**[05:48]** around the capabilities of self-driving vehicles. Then that you could say just

**[05:53]** vehicles. Then that you could say just

**[05:53]** vehicles. Then that you could say just simply can't be handled. It's hopeless.

**[05:56]** simply can't be handled. It's hopeless.

**[05:56]** simply can't be handled. It's hopeless. Furthermore, we're going to talk about

**[05:58]** Furthermore, we're going to talk about

**[05:58]** Furthermore, we're going to talk about some of the powerful techniques in


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** some of the powerful techniques in

**[06:00]** some of the powerful techniques in software verification, but we also know

**[06:02]** software verification, but we also know

**[06:02]** software verification, but we also know and we can prove theoretically that

**[06:04]** and we can prove theoretically that

**[06:04]** and we can prove theoretically that those have limits. There are problems

**[06:06]** those have limits. There are problems

**[06:06]** those have limits. There are problems that are computationally intractable in

**[06:09]** that are computationally intractable in

**[06:09]** that are computationally intractable in some cases.

**[06:11]** some cases.

**[06:11]** some cases. Reason number three is economics. If you

**[06:13]** Reason number three is economics. If you

**[06:13]** Reason number three is economics. If you have competitors who don't care much

**[06:15]** have competitors who don't care much

**[06:15]** have competitors who don't care much about software quality and who will win

**[06:17]** about software quality and who will win

**[06:17]** about software quality and who will win in the marketplace if you spend time on

**[06:20]** in the marketplace if you spend time on

**[06:20]** in the marketplace if you spend time on it, then that reliable software may

**[06:24]** it, then that reliable software may

**[06:24]** it, then that reliable software may never see the light of day. Also, you

**[06:26]** never see the light of day. Also, you

**[06:26]** never see the light of day. Also, you might just say that the ROI just simply

**[06:29]** might just say that the ROI just simply

**[06:29]** might just say that the ROI just simply isn't there for fixing every single bug.

**[06:31]** isn't there for fixing every single bug.

**[06:31]** isn't there for fixing every single bug. Some of them maybe are just not so bad.

**[06:34]** Some of them maybe are just not so bad.

**[06:34]** Some of them maybe are just not so bad. Maybe they have easy workarounds.

**[06:36]** Maybe they have easy workarounds.

**[06:36]** Maybe they have easy workarounds. And finally, perhaps cynically,

**[06:40]** And finally, perhaps cynically,

**[06:40]** And finally, perhaps cynically, some people think that there are

**[06:41]** some people think that there are

**[06:41]** some people think that there are companies that are okay with shipping

**[06:45]** companies that are okay with shipping

**[06:45]** companies that are okay with shipping buggy software because it helps them

**[06:47]** buggy software because it helps them

**[06:47]** buggy software because it helps them sell support.

**[06:49]** sell support.

**[06:49]** sell support. In this vision, this cynical and sad

**[06:52]** In this vision, this cynical and sad

**[06:52]** In this vision, this cynical and sad vision of the world, the bugs win and

**[06:56]** vision of the world, the bugs win and

**[06:56]** vision of the world, the bugs win and we'll never have bug-free software. Not

**[06:59]** we'll never have bug-free software. Not

**[06:59]** we'll never have bug-free software. Not even close. [snorts]


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** even close. [snorts]

**[07:01]** even close. [snorts] Now, I contend that there is hope.

**[07:06]** Now, I contend that there is hope.

**[07:06]** Now, I contend that there is hope. And if we look, there are practices,

**[07:11]** And if we look, there are practices,

**[07:11]** And if we look, there are practices, a whole slew of techniques that really

**[07:16]** a whole slew of techniques that really

**[07:16]** a whole slew of techniques that really allow very reliable software. Let's look

**[07:19]** allow very reliable software. Let's look

**[07:19]** allow very reliable software. Let's look at this example, which is the Airbus

**[07:22]** at this example, which is the Airbus

**[07:22]** at this example, which is the Airbus A320. The control software for this

**[07:25]** A320. The control software for this

**[07:25]** A320. The control software for this airplane was developed in the 1980s and

**[07:30]** airplane was developed in the 1980s and

**[07:30]** airplane was developed in the 1980s and has been held up as a showcase for

**[07:33]** has been held up as a showcase for

**[07:33]** has been held up as a showcase for reliability. There are in fact to this

**[07:36]** reliability. There are in fact to this

**[07:36]** reliability. There are in fact to this date no serious incidents with Airbus

**[07:40]** date no serious incidents with Airbus

**[07:40]** date no serious incidents with Airbus A320 aircraft that have been attributed

**[07:44]** A320 aircraft that have been attributed

**[07:44]** A320 aircraft that have been attributed to problems with the software.

**[07:47]** to problems with the software.

**[07:47]** to problems with the software. So what is their approach?

**[07:51]** So what is their approach?

**[07:52]** So what is their approach? There are a bunch of ideas here that are

**[07:55]** There are a bunch of ideas here that are

**[07:55]** There are a bunch of ideas here that are really pretty neat. So one of them is

**[07:58]** really pretty neat. So one of them is

**[07:58]** really pretty neat. So one of them is Nvers programming. So the most critical


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** Nvers programming. So the most critical

**[08:01]** Nvers programming. So the most critical elements of the Airbus control system

**[08:04]** elements of the Airbus control system

**[08:04]** elements of the Airbus control system [snorts] were actually built with

**[08:06]** [snorts] were actually built with

**[08:06]** [snorts] were actually built with different processors. Say one from x86

**[08:10]** different processors. Say one from x86

**[08:10]** different processors. Say one from x86 from Intel, one Motorola processor,

**[08:12]** from Intel, one Motorola processor,

**[08:12]** from Intel, one Motorola processor, different operating systems on that,

**[08:14]** different operating systems on that,

**[08:14]** different operating systems on that, separate teams writing the software

**[08:17]** separate teams writing the software

**[08:17]** separate teams writing the software providing a tremendous level of

**[08:18]** providing a tremendous level of

**[08:18]** providing a tremendous level of redundancy against unexpected issues.

**[08:22]** redundancy against unexpected issues.

**[08:22]** redundancy against unexpected issues. They also use something called

**[08:23]** They also use something called

**[08:23]** They also use something called specificationbased design. tremendous

**[08:26]** specificationbased design. tremendous

**[08:26]** specificationbased design. tremendous amounts of documentation, but also

**[08:29]** amounts of documentation, but also

**[08:29]** amounts of documentation, but also documentation that could be analyzed in

**[08:33]** documentation that could be analyzed in

**[08:33]** documentation that could be analyzed in order to understand

**[08:35]** order to understand

**[08:35]** order to understand and make provable guarantees about the

**[08:38]** and make provable guarantees about the

**[08:38]** and make provable guarantees about the behavior of the system and what the

**[08:40]** behavior of the system and what the

**[08:40]** behavior of the system and what the software would do under a whole variety

**[08:42]** software would do under a whole variety

**[08:42]** software would do under a whole variety of scenarios. They use independent

**[08:44]** of scenarios. They use independent

**[08:44]** of scenarios. They use independent verification teams where the people

**[08:46]** verification teams where the people

**[08:46]** verification teams where the people writing the code and the people checking

**[17:23]** have modularity without object-oriented

**[17:23]** have modularity without object-oriented programming. Libraries are one of the

**[20:10]** these demos, I'm going to be using the

**[20:10]** these demos, I'm going to be using the Daphne language. What Daphne allows you

**[20:12]** Daphne language. What Daphne allows you

**[20:12]** Daphne language. What Daphne allows you to do is it allows you to use a custom

**[20:16]** to do is it allows you to use a custom

**[20:16]** to do is it allows you to use a custom programming language that generates

**[20:28]** daffany allows you to do is it allows

**[20:28]** daffany allows you to do is it allows you to put proofs in line with your

**[20:30]** you to put proofs in line with your

**[20:30]** you to put proofs in line with your code,

**[20:32]** code,

**[20:32]** code, allowing theorem proving software to

**[20:35]** allowing theorem proving software to

**[20:39]** come along and verify that that code does exactly what you said you wanted to

**[20:42]** does exactly what you said you wanted to

**[20:42]** does exactly what you said you wanted to do. Okay. So I have a program here that

**[20:45]** do. Okay. So I have a program here that

**[20:45]** do. Okay. So I have a program here that is written in the Daftly language and it

**[20:47]** is written in the Daftly language and it

**[20:48]** is written in the Daftly language and it has one function. It's called a method

**[20:50]** has one function. It's called a method

**[20:50]** has one function. It's called a method here and it does something very simple.

**[20:52]** here and it does something very simple.

**[20:52]** here and it does something very simple. So it does index up. So what it's going

**[20:53]** So it does index up. So what it's going

**[20:53]** So it does index up. So what it's going to do is it's going to search an array

**[20:56]** to do is it's going to search an array

**[20:56]** to do is it's going to search an array to find the index of a particular number

**[20:59]** to find the index of a particular number

**[20:59]** to find the index of a particular number and I can write a number of assertions


### [21:00 - 22:00]

**[21:02]** and I can write a number of assertions

**[21:02]** and I can write a number of assertions about this. The array length is greater

**[21:05]** about this. The array length is greater

**[21:05]** about this. The array length is greater than zero. The number returned in that

**[21:09]** than zero. The number returned in that

**[21:09]** than zero. The number returned in that result is either negative 1 if it's not

**[21:11]** result is either negative 1 if it's not

**[21:11]** result is either negative 1 if it's not found or the uh some number that is less

**[21:15]** found or the uh some number that is less

**[21:15]** found or the uh some number that is less than the length of the array and so

**[21:17]** than the length of the array and so

**[21:17]** than the length of the array and so forth. What I can now do is I can just

**[21:20]** forth. What I can now do is I can just

**[21:20]** forth. What I can now do is I can just go ahead and I can run the Daphne

**[21:22]** go ahead and I can run the Daphne

**[21:22]** go ahead and I can run the Daphne verifier on that program.

**[21:27]** verifier on that program.

**[21:27]** verifier on that program. Great, no bugs.

**[21:30]** Great, no bugs.

**[21:30]** Great, no bugs. Let's go ahead and generate a Python

**[21:34]** Let's go ahead and generate a Python

**[21:34]** Let's go ahead and generate a Python program that exercises this

**[21:37]** program that exercises this

**[21:37]** program that exercises this functionality. And we can see that the

**[21:40]** functionality. And we can see that the program first verifies before it runs.

**[21:43]** program first verifies before it runs.

**[21:43]** program first verifies before it runs. So I know that all of those assertions

**[21:45]** So I know that all of those assertions

**[21:45]** So I know that all of those assertions that are proven about the program have

**[21:48]** that are proven about the program have

**[21:48]** that are proven about the program have been checked before that program runs.

**[21:51]** been checked before that program runs.

**[21:51]** been checked before that program runs. This is an extremely powerful technique

**[21:53]** This is an extremely powerful technique

**[21:53]** This is an extremely powerful technique because it spits out a Python library.

**[21:55]** because it spits out a Python library.

**[22:09]** introduced a bug.

**[22:09]** introduced a bug. If I now go back and I try to run that

**[22:12]** If I now go back and I try to run that

**[22:12]** If I now go back and I try to run that again, the verifier steps in and throws

**[22:19]** an error and we are saved from seeing

**[22:20]** an error and we are saved from seeing that bug.

**[22:24]** All right, let's return to the

**[22:24]** All right, let's return to the presentation here. So, one thing to keep

**[22:27]** in mind is that verification is only as

**[22:28]** in mind is that verification is only as good as the specification. If I leave

**[26:32]** languages, doing modular code, these are all sort of things that we pretty much

**[26:34]** all sort of things that we pretty much

**[26:34]** all sort of things that we pretty much do anyway. But some things that we might

**[26:37]** do anyway. But some things that we might

**[26:55]** go wrong is being mitigated in the code.

**[26:55]** go wrong is being mitigated in the code. So this is separate from formal methods.

**[26:57]** So this is separate from formal methods.

**[26:57]** So this is separate from formal methods. This is sort of a um more qualitative


### [27:00 - 28:00]

**[27:03]** This is sort of a um more qualitative

### [30:00 - 31:00]

**[30:00]** think this is just a tremendously

**[30:00]** think this is just a tremendously interesting idea. All right,

**[30:13]** cost? I vibe coded up this very simple

**[30:13]** cost? I vibe coded up this very simple game. I spend about 2 minutes prompting.

**[30:17]** game. I spend about 2 minutes prompting.

**[30:37]** cost to generate this game was about $2.

**[30:37]** cost to generate this game was about $2. And the thing that's interesting here is

**[30:38]** And the thing that's interesting here is

**[30:38]** And the thing that's interesting here is that the cost to generate the output

**[30:42]** that the cost to generate the output

**[30:42]** that the cost to generate the output tokens

**[30:43]** tokens

**[30:43]** tokens is only about 15%

**[30:47]** is only about 15%

**[30:47]** is only about 15% of the overall cost. The rest of which

**[30:53]** is going into the repeated use of input

**[30:53]** is going into the repeated use of input tokens as tests are being run and the

### [31:00 - 32:00]

**[31:00]** reasoning tokens as well. As it with

**[31:15]** right, so let's bring it down and let's

**[31:16]** right, so let's bring it down and let's look at the cost of code. So for high

**[31:17]** look at the cost of code. So for high

**[31:17]** look at the cost of code. So for high assurance code, if we look at something

**[31:19]** assurance code, if we look at something

**[31:19]** assurance code, if we look at something like the space shuttle or the Airbus

**[31:21]** like the space shuttle or the Airbus

**[31:21]** like the space shuttle or the Airbus example, the numbers there, if you take

**[31:26]** $ 1990 from the space shuttle, it was

**[31:26]** $ 1990 from the space shuttle, it was about $1,000 per line of code. If you

**[31:29]** about $1,000 per line of code. If you

**[31:29]** about $1,000 per line of code. If you translate that into $205, it's probably

**[31:32]** translate that into $205, it's probably

**[31:32]** translate that into $205, it's probably more like $2,500. And in some cases, so

**[31:35]** more like $2,500. And in some cases, so

**[31:35]** more like $2,500. And in some cases, so for example, for security high assurance

**[31:38]** for example, for security high assurance

**[31:38]** for example, for security high assurance software, numbers as high as $3,000 per

**[31:41]** software, numbers as high as $3,000 per

**[31:41]** software, numbers as high as $3,000 per line of code have been quoted. For

**[31:43]** line of code have been quoted. For

**[31:43]** line of code have been quoted. For typical software development, it's more

**[31:45]** typical software development, it's more

**[31:45]** typical software development, it's more like $10 to $100 for real production

**[31:49]** like $10 to $100 for real production

**[31:49]** like $10 to $100 for real production software, but nothing that is developed

**[31:52]** software, but nothing that is developed

**[31:52]** software, but nothing that is developed with the high assurance techniques. And

**[31:54]** with the high assurance techniques. And

**[31:54]** with the high assurance techniques. And in some cases, so for example, for

**[31:56]** in some cases, so for example, for

**[31:56]** in some cases, so for example, for security high assurance software numbers

**[31:59]** security high assurance software numbers

**[31:59]** security high assurance software numbers as high as $3,000 per line of code have


### [32:00 - 33:00]

**[32:02]** as high as $3,000 per line of code have

**[32:02]** as high as $3,000 per line of code have been quoted. If you have lowcost

**[32:05]** been quoted. If you have lowcost

**[32:05]** been quoted. If you have lowcost contractors, you may be able to bring

**[32:07]** contractors, you may be able to bring

**[32:07]** contractors, you may be able to bring that number down as low as $1 to $10.

**[32:10]** that number down as low as $1 to $10.

**[32:10]** that number down as low as $1 to $10. This is all without considering any AI

**[32:13]** This is all without considering any AI

**[32:14]** This is all without considering any AI or agentic codegen. For the agentic

**[32:16]** or agentic codegen. For the agentic

**[32:16]** or agentic codegen. For the agentic coding, I've put a pretty broad range

**[32:19]** coding, I've put a pretty broad range

**[32:19]** coding, I've put a pretty broad range that includes just cheap models spinning

**[32:23]** that includes just cheap models spinning

**[32:23]** that includes just cheap models spinning out code. It could probably go even

**[32:26]** lower than this if they're not iterating

**[32:26]** lower than this if they're not iterating on it very much up to more expensive

**[32:30]** on it very much up to more expensive

**[32:30]** on it very much up to more expensive models that are working harder to

**[32:34]** models that are working harder to

**[32:34]** models that are working harder to generate that code. Regardless of how

**[32:37]** generate that code. Regardless of how

**[32:37]** generate that code. Regardless of how you slice the numbers, you're looking at

**[32:40]** you slice the numbers, you're looking at

**[32:40]** you slice the numbers, you're looking at a factor of at least a thousand,

**[32:43]** a factor of at least a thousand,

**[32:44]** a factor of at least a thousand, probably about 10,000. If you set aside

**[32:47]** probably about 10,000. If you set aside

**[32:47]** probably about 10,000. If you set aside the cost of the people involved in the

**[32:49]** the cost of the people involved in the

**[32:49]** the cost of the people involved in the agentic coding, if you just look at that

**[32:50]** agentic coding, if you just look at that

**[32:50]** agentic coding, if you just look at that agentic coding piece, that code is being

**[32:54]** agentic coding piece, that code is being

**[32:54]** agentic coding piece, that code is being generated far more cheaply than typical

**[32:58]** generated far more cheaply than typical

**[32:58]** generated far more cheaply than typical software. And this is interesting


### [33:00 - 34:00]

**[33:02]** software. And this is interesting

**[33:02]** software. And this is interesting because the gap between the cost of high

**[33:04]** because the gap between the cost of high

**[33:04]** because the gap between the cost of high assurance code and typical software is

**[33:07]** assurance code and typical software is

**[33:07]** assurance code and typical software is only about 100x.

**[33:10]** only about 100x.

**[33:10]** only about 100x. So

**[33:12]** So

**[33:12]** So if we extrapolate

**[33:21]** we could conclude that agentic coding

**[33:21]** we could conclude that agentic coding has the potential to produce high

**[33:24]** has the potential to produce high

**[33:24]** has the potential to produce high assurance software
