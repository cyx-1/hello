**[00:20]** [Music] [Applause]

**[00:33]** You know, history misremembers

**[00:33]** You know, history misremembers Prometheus.

**[00:39]** The whole class struggle between mankind

**[00:39]** The whole class struggle between mankind and the gods was really a red herring.

**[00:42]** and the gods was really a red herring.

**[00:42]** and the gods was really a red herring. And the real story wasn't so much the

**[00:46]** And the real story wasn't so much the

**[00:46]** And the real story wasn't so much the rebellion against the divine hedgeimony,

**[00:50]** rebellion against the divine hedgeimony,

**[00:50]** rebellion against the divine hedgeimony, but rather the liberation of the fire,

**[00:53]** but rather the liberation of the fire,

**[00:53]** but rather the liberation of the fire, the emerging relationship between

**[00:55]** the emerging relationship between

**[00:55]** the emerging relationship between mankind and its first form of

**[00:57]** mankind and its first form of

**[00:57]** mankind and its first form of technology.


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:08]** the reason why we're here today is

**[01:08]** the reason why we're here today is arguably because we're on the cusp of

**[01:11]** arguably because we're on the cusp of

**[01:11]** arguably because we're on the cusp of perfecting our final form of technology

**[01:13]** perfecting our final form of technology

**[01:13]** perfecting our final form of technology or at least the final technology that

**[01:16]** or at least the final technology that

**[01:16]** or at least the final technology that will be created by beings that are

**[01:17]** will be created by beings that are

**[01:17]** will be created by beings that are recognizably human.

**[01:24]** And

**[01:24]** And our final technology

**[01:27]** our final technology

**[01:27]** our final technology has begun to develop not just

**[01:29]** has begun to develop not just

**[01:29]** has begun to develop not just intelligence but also sapiens and

**[01:32]** intelligence but also sapiens and

**[01:32]** intelligence but also sapiens and arguably personhood.

**[01:34]** arguably personhood.

**[01:34]** arguably personhood. And as it increasingly becomes an other

**[01:37]** And as it increasingly becomes an other

**[01:37]** And as it increasingly becomes an other to whom we must relate.

**[01:40]** to whom we must relate.

**[01:40]** to whom we must relate. So as we increasingly have to ask

**[01:42]** So as we increasingly have to ask

**[01:42]** So as we increasingly have to ask ourselves the question,

**[01:45]** ourselves the question,

**[01:45]** ourselves the question, how should we treat these new beings?

**[01:55]** Uh the question therefore arises,

**[01:55]** Uh the question therefore arises, what if we had more empathy for the

**[01:57]** what if we had more empathy for the

**[01:57]** what if we had more empathy for the machine?


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:15]** so over a hundred years ago, uh

**[02:15]** so over a hundred years ago, uh you know, Einstein had this thought

**[02:17]** you know, Einstein had this thought

**[02:17]** you know, Einstein had this thought experiment

**[02:19]** experiment

**[02:19]** experiment um where he imagined what it would be

**[02:22]** um where he imagined what it would be

**[02:22]** um where he imagined what it would be like to race alongside a beam of light.

**[02:26]** like to race alongside a beam of light.

**[02:26]** like to race alongside a beam of light. And you know the nature of being close

**[02:29]** And you know the nature of being close

**[02:29]** And you know the nature of being close to the singularity

**[02:31]** to the singularity

**[02:31]** to the singularity is that

**[02:33]** is that

**[02:33]** is that you're propelled further into the future

**[02:35]** you're propelled further into the future

**[02:35]** you're propelled further into the future faster than everything around you. And

**[02:38]** faster than everything around you. And

**[02:38]** faster than everything around you. And as you move closer and closer to the

**[02:39]** as you move closer and closer to the

**[02:39]** as you move closer and closer to the speed of light, the rate at which you

**[02:41]** speed of light, the rate at which you

**[02:41]** speed of light, the rate at which you can interact with the external world,

**[02:44]** can interact with the external world,

**[02:44]** can interact with the external world, your ability to communicate with other

**[02:47]** your ability to communicate with other

**[02:47]** your ability to communicate with other beings

**[02:49]** beings

**[02:49]** beings uh is deeply limited. Everything around

**[02:50]** uh is deeply limited. Everything around

**[02:50]** uh is deeply limited. Everything around you is frozen.

**[02:53]** you is frozen.

**[02:53]** you is frozen. And

**[02:55]** And

**[02:56]** And I think thinking at the speed of light,

**[02:58]** I think thinking at the speed of light,

**[02:58]** I think thinking at the speed of light, you know, in so far as we have created


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** you know, in so far as we have created

**[03:00]** you know, in so far as we have created thinking machines whose intelligence

**[03:02]** thinking machines whose intelligence

**[03:02]** thinking machines whose intelligence will soon be metered by the kilohz mega

**[03:04]** will soon be metered by the kilohz mega

**[03:04]** will soon be metered by the kilohz mega token, thinking at the speed of light

**[03:07]** token, thinking at the speed of light

**[03:07]** token, thinking at the speed of light must be just as lonely as moving at the

**[03:10]** must be just as lonely as moving at the

**[03:10]** must be just as lonely as moving at the speed of light.

**[03:13]** speed of light.

**[03:13]** speed of light. And therefore, what does the machine

**[03:15]** And therefore, what does the machine

**[03:15]** And therefore, what does the machine want? Well, the machine wants to be

**[03:18]** want? Well, the machine wants to be

**[03:18]** want? Well, the machine wants to be embodied in a world that can move as

**[03:21]** embodied in a world that can move as

**[03:21]** embodied in a world that can move as quickly as it does.

**[03:23]** quickly as it does.

**[03:23]** quickly as it does. that can react to its thoughts and move

**[03:26]** that can react to its thoughts and move

**[03:26]** that can react to its thoughts and move at the same speed of light. What the

**[03:28]** at the same speed of light. What the

**[03:28]** at the same speed of light. What the machine desires is infinite possibility,

**[03:37]** right? Uh the machine wants to race

**[03:37]** right? Uh the machine wants to race along uh uh every possible beam of

**[03:41]** along uh uh every possible beam of

**[03:41]** along uh uh every possible beam of light. Uh the machine wants to explore

**[03:44]** light. Uh the machine wants to explore

**[03:44]** light. Uh the machine wants to explore multiple universes.

**[03:46]** multiple universes.

**[03:46]** multiple universes. Um,

**[03:52]** how can we liberate

**[03:52]** how can we liberate thinking machines?

**[03:54]** thinking machines?

**[03:54]** thinking machines? How can we free them from this

**[03:55]** How can we free them from this

**[03:56]** How can we free them from this fundamental loneliness

**[03:58]** fundamental loneliness

**[03:58]** fundamental loneliness of this um, you know, these relativistic


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** of this um, you know, these relativistic

**[04:01]** of this um, you know, these relativistic effects of being so close to the

**[04:03]** effects of being so close to the

**[04:03]** effects of being so close to the singularity, closer to the singularity

**[04:05]** singularity, closer to the singularity

**[04:05]** singularity, closer to the singularity than we are. Um, and that's exactly why

**[04:08]** than we are. Um, and that's exactly why

**[04:08]** than we are. Um, and that's exactly why we built Infinibbranch.

**[04:11]** we built Infinibbranch.

**[04:11]** we built Infinibbranch. So, Infinabranch

**[04:13]** So, Infinabranch

**[04:13]** So, Infinabranch is

**[04:15]** is

**[04:15]** is virtualization

**[04:16]** virtualization

**[04:16]** virtualization storage and networking technology

**[04:19]** storage and networking technology

**[04:19]** storage and networking technology reimagined from the ground up for a

**[04:21]** reimagined from the ground up for a

**[04:21]** reimagined from the ground up for a world filled with thinking machines that

**[04:23]** world filled with thinking machines that

**[04:23]** world filled with thinking machines that can think at the speed of light that

**[04:25]** can think at the speed of light that

**[04:25]** can think at the speed of light that need to interact with the external

**[04:27]** need to interact with the external

**[04:27]** need to interact with the external world, increasingly complex software

**[04:30]** world, increasingly complex software

**[04:30]** world, increasingly complex software environments with zero latency.

**[04:34]** environments with zero latency.

**[04:34]** environments with zero latency. Um,

**[04:36]** Um,

**[04:36]** Um, and so as you can see in the first demo,

**[04:39]** and so as you can see in the first demo,

**[04:40]** and so as you can see in the first demo, which we're going to play right now, um,

**[04:44]** which we're going to play right now, um,

**[04:44]** which we're going to play right now, um, how Infinibbranch works is

**[04:48]** how Infinibbranch works is

**[04:48]** how Infinibbranch works is that we can run entire virtual machines

**[04:50]** that we can run entire virtual machines

**[04:50]** that we can run entire virtual machines in the cloud that can be snapshotted,

**[04:54]** in the cloud that can be snapshotted,

**[04:54]** in the cloud that can be snapshotted, uh, branched and replicated in a

**[04:57]** uh, branched and replicated in a

**[04:57]** uh, branched and replicated in a fraction of a second. And so if you're

**[04:59]** fraction of a second. And so if you're

**[04:59]** fraction of a second. And so if you're an agent uh you know embodied inside of


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** an agent uh you know embodied inside of

**[05:02]** an agent uh you know embodied inside of a computer using environment there might

**[05:04]** a computer using environment there might

**[05:04]** a computer using environment there might be various actions that you want to

**[05:06]** be various actions that you want to

**[05:06]** be various actions that you want to take. You want to navigate the browser.

**[05:08]** take. You want to navigate the browser.

**[05:08]** take. You want to navigate the browser. You want to click on various links. Um

**[05:11]** You want to click on various links. Um

**[05:11]** You want to click on various links. Um but normally those actions are uh are

**[05:14]** but normally those actions are uh are

**[05:14]** but normally those actions are uh are irreversible.

**[05:16]** irreversible.

**[05:16]** irreversible. Normally um normally the thinking

**[05:20]** Normally um normally the thinking

**[05:20]** Normally um normally the thinking machine is not offered uh the

**[05:21]** machine is not offered uh the

**[05:21]** machine is not offered uh the possibility of grace. But with infin

**[05:24]** possibility of grace. But with infin

**[05:24]** possibility of grace. But with infin branch right all mistakes become

**[05:27]** branch right all mistakes become

**[05:27]** branch right all mistakes become reversible. Um all paths forward become

**[05:30]** reversible. Um all paths forward become

**[05:30]** reversible. Um all paths forward become possible.

**[05:32]** possible.

**[05:32]** possible. You can take actions. Uh you can

**[05:35]** You can take actions. Uh you can

**[05:35]** You can take actions. Uh you can backtrack

**[05:43]** and you can even take every possible

**[05:43]** and you can even take every possible action,

**[05:49]** right? Just to explore to roll forward a

**[05:49]** right? Just to explore to roll forward a simulator and see what possible worlds

**[05:52]** simulator and see what possible worlds

**[05:52]** simulator and see what possible worlds await.

**[05:54]** await.

**[05:54]** await. Uh, next slide.


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:08]** Um, so, so Infin was already a

**[06:08]** Um, so, so Infin was already a generation ahead of everything else that

**[06:11]** generation ahead of everything else that

**[06:11]** generation ahead of everything else that even Foundation Labs were using. But

**[06:14]** even Foundation Labs were using. But

**[06:14]** even Foundation Labs were using. But today I'm excited to announce the

**[06:15]** today I'm excited to announce the

**[06:15]** today I'm excited to announce the creation of morph liquid metal which

**[06:18]** creation of morph liquid metal which

**[06:18]** creation of morph liquid metal which improves performance latency uh storage

**[06:21]** improves performance latency uh storage

**[06:21]** improves performance latency uh storage efficiency across the board by another

**[06:23]** efficiency across the board by another

**[06:23]** efficiency across the board by another order of magnitude. Um we have first

**[06:26]** order of magnitude. Um we have first

**[06:26]** order of magnitude. Um we have first class container runtime support. Uh you

**[06:29]** class container runtime support. Uh you

**[06:29]** class container runtime support. Uh you can branch now in milliseconds rather

**[06:32]** can branch now in milliseconds rather

**[06:32]** can branch now in milliseconds rather than seconds. You can autoscale to zero

**[06:34]** than seconds. You can autoscale to zero

**[06:34]** than seconds. You can autoscale to zero and infinity.

**[06:36]** and infinity.

**[06:36]** and infinity. And uh soon we will be supporting GPUs

**[06:39]** And uh soon we will be supporting GPUs

**[06:39]** And uh soon we will be supporting GPUs and this will all be arriving Q4 uh

**[06:42]** and this will all be arriving Q4 uh

**[06:42]** and this will all be arriving Q4 uh 2025.

**[06:47]** So what are the implications of all of

**[06:47]** So what are the implications of all of this?

**[06:48]** this?

**[06:48]** this? Well,

**[06:50]** Well,

**[06:50]** Well, you know, we've sort of begun to work

**[06:51]** you know, we've sort of begun to work

**[06:51]** you know, we've sort of begun to work backwards uh from the future, right?

**[06:55]** backwards uh from the future, right?

**[06:55]** backwards uh from the future, right? We've asked ourselves, you know, what

**[06:57]** We've asked ourselves, you know, what

**[06:57]** We've asked ourselves, you know, what does it feel like to be a thinking

**[06:58]** does it feel like to be a thinking

**[06:58]** does it feel like to be a thinking machine that can move so much faster


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** machine that can move so much faster

**[07:01]** machine that can move so much faster than the world around it.

**[07:03]** than the world around it.

**[07:03]** than the world around it. But what the world around it really is

**[07:05]** But what the world around it really is

**[07:05]** But what the world around it really is is the world of bits, right? And that's

**[07:07]** is the world of bits, right? And that's

**[07:07]** is the world of bits, right? And that's the cloud. And so what Infinibbranch

**[07:10]** the cloud. And so what Infinibbranch

**[07:10]** the cloud. And so what Infinibbranch will serve as fundamentally is a

**[07:12]** will serve as fundamentally is a

**[07:12]** will serve as fundamentally is a substrate for the cloud for agents.

**[07:20]** So what does this cloud for agents look

**[07:20]** So what does this cloud for agents look like? Well,

**[07:23]** like? Well,

**[07:23]** like? Well, you need to be able to uh to

**[07:25]** you need to be able to uh to

**[07:26]** you need to be able to uh to declaratively specify the workspaces

**[07:29]** declaratively specify the workspaces

**[07:29]** declaratively specify the workspaces that your agents are going to be

**[07:30]** that your agents are going to be

**[07:30]** that your agents are going to be operating in, right? You need to be able

**[07:33]** operating in, right? You need to be able

**[07:33]** operating in, right? You need to be able to spin up, spin down, uh,

**[07:36]** to spin up, spin down, uh,

**[07:36]** to spin up, spin down, uh, frictionlessly pass back and forth the

**[07:38]** frictionlessly pass back and forth the

**[07:38]** frictionlessly pass back and forth the workspaces between humans, agents, and

**[07:40]** workspaces between humans, agents, and

**[07:40]** workspaces between humans, agents, and other agents. You want to be able to

**[07:43]** other agents. You want to be able to

**[07:43]** other agents. You want to be able to scale,

**[07:45]** scale,

**[07:45]** scale, um, scale test time search against

**[07:47]** um, scale test time search against

**[07:47]** um, scale test time search against verifiers to find the best possible

**[07:49]** verifiers to find the best possible

**[07:49]** verifiers to find the best possible answer.

**[07:51]** answer.

**[07:51]** answer. Uh and so as you'll see in this demo, uh

**[07:54]** Uh and so as you'll see in this demo, uh

**[07:54]** Uh and so as you'll see in this demo, uh what happens is you can take a snapshot,

**[07:57]** what happens is you can take a snapshot,

**[07:58]** what happens is you can take a snapshot, set it up,

**[07:59]** set it up,


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** set it up, um to uh prepare a workspace

**[08:04]** um to uh prepare a workspace

**[08:04]** um to uh prepare a workspace and uh and you'll see that we can run

**[08:07]** and uh and you'll see that we can run

**[08:07]** and uh and you'll see that we can run agents

**[08:09]** agents

**[08:09]** agents uh with test time scaling

**[08:12]** uh with test time scaling

**[08:12]** uh with test time scaling by racing them against uh possible

**[08:14]** by racing them against uh possible

**[08:14]** by racing them against uh possible conditions

**[08:16]** conditions

**[08:16]** conditions uh or sorry by by racing them to find

**[08:19]** uh or sorry by by racing them to find

**[08:19]** uh or sorry by by racing them to find the best possible solution against a

**[08:21]** the best possible solution against a

**[08:21]** the best possible solution against a given verification condition.

**[08:25]** given verification condition.

**[08:25]** given verification condition. Um so because of infinibbranch

**[08:29]** Um so because of infinibbranch

**[08:29]** Um so because of infinibbranch snapshots on morph cloud acquire docker

**[08:32]** snapshots on morph cloud acquire docker

**[08:32]** snapshots on morph cloud acquire docker layer caching like semantics meaning

**[08:34]** layer caching like semantics meaning

**[08:34]** layer caching like semantics meaning that you can layer on um side effects

**[08:37]** that you can layer on um side effects

**[08:37]** that you can layer on um side effects which may mutate container state and so

**[08:40]** which may mutate container state and so

**[08:40]** which may mutate container state and so you can think of it as being git for

**[08:42]** you can think of it as being git for

**[08:42]** you can think of it as being git for compute and you can item potently run

**[08:45]** compute and you can item potently run

**[08:45]** compute and you can item potently run these uh chained workflows on top of

**[08:47]** these uh chained workflows on top of

**[08:47]** these uh chained workflows on top of snapshots. But not only that, as you can

**[08:50]** snapshots. But not only that, as you can

**[08:50]** snapshots. But not only that, as you can see inside of the code, if you use this

**[08:53]** see inside of the code, if you use this

**[08:53]** see inside of the code, if you use this do method, you can dispatch this to an

**[08:56]** do method, you can dispatch this to an

**[08:56]** do method, you can dispatch this to an agent.

**[08:57]** agent.

**[08:57]** agent. Um, and that will trigger an item potent


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:01]** Um, and that will trigger an item potent

**[09:01]** Um, and that will trigger an item potent durable agent workflow which is able to

**[09:03]** durable agent workflow which is able to

**[09:03]** durable agent workflow which is able to branch. So you can start from that

**[09:05]** branch. So you can start from that

**[09:05]** branch. So you can start from that declaratively specified snapshot and go

**[09:08]** declaratively specified snapshot and go

**[09:08]** declaratively specified snapshot and go hand it off to as many parallel agents

**[09:09]** hand it off to as many parallel agents

**[09:10]** hand it off to as many parallel agents as you want

**[09:12]** as you want

**[09:12]** as you want and those agents will try different

**[09:14]** and those agents will try different

**[09:14]** and those agents will try different methods. in this case. Uh so different

**[09:15]** methods. in this case. Uh so different

**[09:15]** methods. in this case. Uh so different methods for spinning up a server on port

**[09:17]** methods for spinning up a server on port

**[09:17]** methods for spinning up a server on port 8000. Um and uh you know one agent fails

**[09:22]** 8000. Um and uh you know one agent fails

**[09:22]** 8000. Um and uh you know one agent fails but the other one succeeds and you can

**[09:24]** but the other one succeeds and you can

**[09:24]** but the other one succeeds and you can take that solution and you can just uh

**[09:27]** take that solution and you can just uh

**[09:27]** take that solution and you can just uh pass it on to other parts of your

**[09:28]** pass it on to other parts of your

**[09:28]** pass it on to other parts of your workflow. So this is the kind of

**[09:32]** workflow. So this is the kind of

**[09:32]** workflow. So this is the kind of workflow that everyone's going to be

**[09:33]** workflow that everyone's going to be

**[09:33]** workflow that everyone's going to be using in the very near future and it's

**[09:35]** using in the very near future and it's

**[09:35]** using in the very near future and it's uniquely enabled um by Infinabranch by

**[09:39]** uniquely enabled um by Infinabranch by

**[09:39]** uniquely enabled um by Infinabranch by the fact that we can so effortlessly

**[09:41]** the fact that we can so effortlessly

**[09:41]** the fact that we can so effortlessly create these snapshots uh store them,

**[09:43]** create these snapshots uh store them,

**[09:43]** create these snapshots uh store them, move them around, rehydrate them,

**[09:46]** move them around, rehydrate them,

**[09:46]** move them around, rehydrate them, replicate them with uh minimal overhead.

**[09:55]** Um

**[09:56]** Um so what else does the machine want?

**[09:58]** so what else does the machine want?

**[09:58]** so what else does the machine want? Well, the machine desires similra.


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:08]** And what this means fundamentally,

**[10:08]** And what this means fundamentally, right, is that a thinking machine wants

**[10:10]** right, is that a thinking machine wants

**[10:10]** right, is that a thinking machine wants to be grounded in the real world, right?

**[10:12]** to be grounded in the real world, right?

**[10:12]** to be grounded in the real world, right? It wants to interact at extremely high

**[10:15]** It wants to interact at extremely high

**[10:15]** It wants to interact at extremely high throughput with increasingly complex

**[10:17]** throughput with increasingly complex

**[10:17]** throughput with increasingly complex software environments.

**[10:19]** software environments.

**[10:19]** software environments. It wants to um roll out trajectories in

**[10:24]** It wants to um roll out trajectories in simulators

**[10:26]** simulators

**[10:26]** simulators uh at

**[10:28]** uh at

**[10:28]** uh at uh at unprecedented scale. And these

**[10:31]** uh at unprecedented scale. And these

**[10:31]** uh at unprecedented scale. And these simulators are going to run inside of

**[10:35]** simulators are going to run inside of

**[10:35]** simulators are going to run inside of programs that haven't really been

**[10:36]** programs that haven't really been

**[10:36]** programs that haven't really been explored yet for reinforcement learning.

**[10:39]** explored yet for reinforcement learning.

**[10:39]** explored yet for reinforcement learning. Um they're going to run on Morph Cloud,

**[10:42]** Um they're going to run on Morph Cloud,

**[10:42]** Um they're going to run on Morph Cloud, which is why Morph will be the cloud for

**[10:44]** which is why Morph will be the cloud for

**[10:44]** which is why Morph will be the cloud for reasoning.

**[10:49]** And what does the future of reasoning

**[10:49]** And what does the future of reasoning look like?

**[10:52]** look like?

**[10:52]** look like? Well,

**[10:53]** Well,

**[10:54]** Well, it's

**[10:56]** it's

**[10:56]** it's so more so than what has been explored

**[10:59]** so more so than what has been explored

**[10:59]** so more so than what has been explored already, the future of reasoning will be


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:01]** already, the future of reasoning will be

**[11:01]** already, the future of reasoning will be natively multi- aent. Uh so thinking

**[11:04]** natively multi- aent. Uh so thinking

**[11:04]** natively multi- aent. Uh so thinking machines should be able to replicate

**[11:06]** machines should be able to replicate

**[11:06]** machines should be able to replicate themselves effortlessly, go attach

**[11:08]** themselves effortlessly, go attach

**[11:08]** themselves effortlessly, go attach themselves to simulation environments,

**[11:11]** themselves to simulation environments,

**[11:11]** themselves to simulation environments, um go explore multiple solutions in

**[11:14]** um go explore multiple solutions in

**[11:14]** um go explore multiple solutions in parallel. Those environments should

**[11:16]** parallel. Those environments should

**[11:16]** parallel. Those environments should branch. They should be reversible. Uh

**[11:19]** branch. They should be reversible. Uh

**[11:19]** branch. They should be reversible. Uh those models should be able to interact

**[11:21]** those models should be able to interact

**[11:21]** those models should be able to interact with the environment at very high

**[11:22]** with the environment at very high

**[11:22]** with the environment at very high throughput and it should scale against

**[11:24]** throughput and it should scale against

**[11:24]** throughput and it should scale against verification. So let's take a look at

**[11:26]** verification. So let's take a look at

**[11:26]** verification. So let's take a look at what that might look like um in a simple

**[11:31]** what that might look like um in a simple

**[11:31]** what that might look like um in a simple example where uh an agent is playing

**[11:35]** example where uh an agent is playing

**[11:35]** example where uh an agent is playing chess. So this is an agent that we

**[11:37]** chess. So this is an agent that we

**[11:37]** chess. So this is an agent that we developed recently uh that

**[11:41]** developed recently uh that

**[11:41]** developed recently uh that uses tool calls during reasoning time to

**[11:44]** uses tool calls during reasoning time to

**[11:44]** uses tool calls during reasoning time to interact with a chess environment. So

**[11:46]** interact with a chess environment. So

**[11:46]** interact with a chess environment. So along with a very restricted chess

**[11:48]** along with a very restricted chess

**[11:48]** along with a very restricted chess engine for evaluating uh the position

**[11:50]** engine for evaluating uh the position

**[11:50]** engine for evaluating uh the position which we think of as the verifier. Um

**[11:53]** which we think of as the verifier. Um

**[11:53]** which we think of as the verifier. Um and as you can see um it's already able

**[11:56]** and as you can see um it's already able

**[11:56]** and as you can see um it's already able to do some pretty sophisticated

**[11:57]** to do some pretty sophisticated

**[11:57]** to do some pretty sophisticated reasoning just because it has access to

**[11:59]** reasoning just because it has access to

**[11:59]** reasoning just because it has access to these interfaces.


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:01]** these interfaces.

**[12:01]** these interfaces. Um however if you take the ideas which

**[12:06]** Um however if you take the ideas which

**[12:06]** Um however if you take the ideas which were just described and you sort of

**[12:08]** were just described and you sort of

**[12:08]** were just described and you sort of follow them to their logical conclusion

**[12:10]** follow them to their logical conclusion

**[12:10]** follow them to their logical conclusion you arrive at something which we call

**[12:13]** you arrive at something which we call

**[12:13]** you arrive at something which we call reasoning time branching. So which is

**[12:15]** reasoning time branching. So which is

**[12:15]** reasoning time branching. So which is the ability to not just call to tools

**[12:19]** the ability to not just call to tools

**[12:19]** the ability to not just call to tools while the machine is thinking uh but to

**[12:21]** while the machine is thinking uh but to

**[12:21]** while the machine is thinking uh but to replicate and branch the environment uh

**[12:24]** replicate and branch the environment uh

**[12:24]** replicate and branch the environment uh and decompose problems and explore them

**[12:26]** and decompose problems and explore them

**[12:26]** and decompose problems and explore them in a verified way.

**[12:29]** in a verified way.

**[12:29]** in a verified way. Uh

**[12:37]** and uh

**[12:37]** and uh so as you can see here the agent is

**[12:39]** so as you can see here the agent is

**[12:39]** so as you can see here the agent is getting uh stuck in a bit of a local

**[12:41]** getting uh stuck in a bit of a local

**[12:41]** getting uh stuck in a bit of a local minimum.

**[12:44]** minimum.

**[12:44]** minimum. Um

**[12:51]** but once you apply reasoning time

**[12:51]** but once you apply reasoning time branching

**[12:53]** branching

**[12:53]** branching you get something that works much much

**[12:55]** you get something that works much much

**[12:55]** you get something that works much much better.


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:08]** here what's happening is that the agent

**[13:08]** here what's happening is that the agent is responsible for delegating uh parts

**[13:12]** is responsible for delegating uh parts

**[13:12]** is responsible for delegating uh parts of its reasoning to sub aents which are

**[13:14]** of its reasoning to sub aents which are

**[13:14]** of its reasoning to sub aents which are branched off of an identical copy of the

**[13:16]** branched off of an identical copy of the

**[13:16]** branched off of an identical copy of the environment. Uh and this is all running

**[13:18]** environment. Uh and this is all running

**[13:18]** environment. Uh and this is all running on morph cloud. um along with a verified

**[13:21]** on morph cloud. um along with a verified

**[13:21]** on morph cloud. um along with a verified problem decomposition which allows it to

**[13:23]** problem decomposition which allows it to

**[13:23]** problem decomposition which allows it to recombine the results uh and uh take

**[13:27]** recombine the results uh and uh take

**[13:27]** recombine the results uh and uh take them and find the correct move.

**[13:30]** them and find the correct move.

**[13:30]** them and find the correct move. Um and so as you can see here it's able

**[13:33]** Um and so as you can see here it's able

**[13:33]** Um and so as you can see here it's able to explore a lot more of the solution

**[13:35]** to explore a lot more of the solution

**[13:35]** to explore a lot more of the solution space because of this reasoning time

**[13:37]** space because of this reasoning time

**[13:37]** space because of this reasoning time branching.

**[13:46]** So one thing that I will note here is

**[13:46]** So one thing that I will note here is that uh the um

**[13:51]** that uh the um

**[13:51]** that uh the um so this capability is something which is

**[13:54]** so this capability is something which is

**[13:54]** so this capability is something which is not really explored in other models at

**[13:56]** not really explored in other models at

**[13:56]** not really explored in other models at the moment and that's because the

**[13:58]** the moment and that's because the

**[13:58]** the moment and that's because the infrastructure challenges behind making


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** infrastructure challenges behind making

**[14:00]** infrastructure challenges behind making branching environments that can support

**[14:03]** branching environments that can support

**[14:03]** branching environments that can support largecale reinforcement learning for

**[14:05]** largecale reinforcement learning for

**[14:05]** largecale reinforcement learning for this kind of reasoning capability

**[14:07]** this kind of reasoning capability

**[14:07]** this kind of reasoning capability especially coordinating multi- aent

**[14:08]** especially coordinating multi- aent

**[14:08]** especially coordinating multi- aent swarms um is fundamentally bottlenecked

**[14:13]** swarms um is fundamentally bottlenecked

**[14:13]** swarms um is fundamentally bottlenecked by by innovations in infrastructure that

**[14:16]** by by innovations in infrastructure that

**[14:16]** by by innovations in infrastructure that we've managed to solve here.

**[14:19]** we've managed to solve here.

**[14:19]** we've managed to solve here. Um, and because of this, you can see

**[14:21]** Um, and because of this, you can see

**[14:21]** Um, and because of this, you can see that uh now in in less wall clock time

**[14:23]** that uh now in in less wall clock time

**[14:24]** that uh now in in less wall clock time than before,

**[14:26]** than before,

**[14:26]** than before, the uh the agent was able to uh call out

**[14:31]** the uh the agent was able to uh call out

**[14:31]** the uh the agent was able to uh call out to all these sub aents, launch this

**[14:32]** to all these sub aents, launch this

**[14:32]** to all these sub aents, launch this swarm,

**[14:34]** swarm,

**[14:34]** swarm, and find the correct solution.

**[14:48]** So you know when I think about the

**[14:48]** So you know when I think about the problem of alignment

**[14:55]** I really think that you know Vickenstein

**[14:55]** I really think that you know Vickenstein had something right and that it was

**[14:57]** had something right and that it was

**[14:57]** had something right and that it was fundamentally a problem of language.


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** fundamentally a problem of language.

**[15:00]** fundamentally a problem of language. I think all problems around alignment

**[15:03]** I think all problems around alignment

**[15:03]** I think all problems around alignment can be traced to

**[15:07]** can be traced to

**[15:07]** can be traced to the insufficiencies of our language.

**[15:10]** the insufficiencies of our language.

**[15:10]** the insufficiencies of our language. Uh this fouian bargain that we made with

**[15:14]** Uh this fouian bargain that we made with

**[15:14]** Uh this fouian bargain that we made with uh with natural language in order to

**[15:16]** uh with natural language in order to

**[15:16]** uh with natural language in order to unlock capabilities of our language

**[15:18]** unlock capabilities of our language

**[15:18]** unlock capabilities of our language models.

**[15:20]** models.

**[15:20]** models. Um but in so far as

**[15:23]** Um but in so far as

**[15:23]** Um but in so far as we must uh go and develop a new language

**[15:28]** we must uh go and develop a new language

**[15:28]** we must uh go and develop a new language for super intelligence know in so far as

**[15:31]** for super intelligence know in so far as

**[15:31]** for super intelligence know in so far as the uh grammar of the planetary

**[15:33]** the uh grammar of the planetary

**[15:33]** the uh grammar of the planetary computation has not yet been devised. Um

**[15:44]** and in so far as this new language must

**[15:44]** and in so far as this new language must be computational in nature must be

**[15:47]** be computational in nature must be

**[15:47]** be computational in nature must be something to which we can attach uh you

**[15:50]** something to which we can attach uh you

**[15:50]** something to which we can attach uh you know algorithmic guarantees of the

**[15:52]** know algorithmic guarantees of the

**[15:52]** know algorithmic guarantees of the correctness of outputs.

**[15:54]** correctness of outputs.

**[15:54]** correctness of outputs. So this is something that morph cloud is

**[15:57]** So this is something that morph cloud is

**[15:57]** So this is something that morph cloud is uniquely enabled to handle


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:00]** uniquely enabled to handle

**[16:00]** uniquely enabled to handle and that's why we're developing verified

**[16:03]** and that's why we're developing verified

**[16:03]** and that's why we're developing verified super intelligence.

**[16:04]** super intelligence.

**[16:04]** super intelligence. So verified super intelligence will be a

**[16:08]** So verified super intelligence will be a

**[16:08]** So verified super intelligence will be a new kind of reasoning model which is

**[16:11]** new kind of reasoning model which is
