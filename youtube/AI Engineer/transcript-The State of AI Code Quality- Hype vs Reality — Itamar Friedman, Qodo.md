**[00:22]** I'm really excited being here. So many

**[00:22]** I'm really excited being here. So many so much pragmatic and insight and

**[00:24]** so much pragmatic and insight and

**[00:24]** so much pragmatic and insight and suggestions. I was sitting there uh just

**[00:26]** suggestions. I was sitting there uh just

**[00:26]** suggestions. I was sitting there uh just just before. So I'm Edomar Freriedman

**[00:28]** just before. So I'm Edomar Freriedman

**[00:28]** just before. So I'm Edomar Freriedman the CEO and co-founder of Kodto. Codto

**[00:30]** the CEO and co-founder of Kodto. Codto

**[00:30]** the CEO and co-founder of Kodto. Codto stands for quality of development and

**[00:33]** stands for quality of development and

**[00:33]** stands for quality of development and I'm going to share uh our reports and

**[00:36]** I'm going to share uh our reports and

**[00:36]** I'm going to share uh our reports and other companies reports about state of

**[00:37]** other companies reports about state of

**[00:37]** other companies reports about state of AI code quality. Uh you know trying to

**[00:41]** AI code quality. Uh you know trying to

**[00:41]** AI code quality. Uh you know trying to uh talk about the hype versus reality

**[00:43]** uh talk about the hype versus reality

**[00:43]** uh talk about the hype versus reality which was uh like one of the uh points

**[00:46]** which was uh like one of the uh points

**[00:46]** which was uh like one of the uh points that were discussed here quite a lot

**[00:47]** that were discussed here quite a lot

**[00:47]** that were discussed here quite a lot which is awesome. So in the last three

**[00:50]** which is awesome. So in the last three

**[00:50]** which is awesome. So in the last three weeks, four weeks, we saw like three

**[00:52]** weeks, four weeks, we saw like three

**[00:52]** weeks, four weeks, we saw like three outages in the clouds, unfortunately,

**[00:54]** outages in the clouds, unfortunately,

**[00:54]** outages in the clouds, unfortunately, right? And these are coming from

**[00:57]** right? And these are coming from

**[00:57]** right? And these are coming from companies that really care about moving

**[00:59]** companies that really care about moving

**[00:59]** companies that really care about moving fast, right? They're they're they're


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** fast, right? They're they're they're

**[01:01]** fast, right? They're they're they're saying themselves that they're using AI

**[01:03]** saying themselves that they're using AI

**[01:03]** saying themselves that they're using AI to generate code 10%, 30%, 50%, at the

**[01:07]** to generate code 10%, 30%, 50%, at the

**[01:07]** to generate code 10%, 30%, 50%, at the same time, they care about quality. So

**[01:09]** same time, they care about quality. So

**[01:09]** same time, they care about quality. So how did that happen? And is it is it

**[01:11]** how did that happen? And is it is it

**[01:11]** how did that happen? And is it is it related? I don't know. But let's have

**[01:13]** related? I don't know. But let's have

**[01:13]** related? I don't know. But let's have some I'm going to share some guess. So

**[01:15]** some I'm going to share some guess. So

**[01:15]** some I'm going to share some guess. So by the way 60% of developers say that

**[01:18]** by the way 60% of developers say that

**[01:18]** by the way 60% of developers say that the like quarter of their code is either

**[01:21]** the like quarter of their code is either

**[01:21]** the like quarter of their code is either generated by AI or in in like uh uh

**[01:24]** generated by AI or in in like uh uh

**[01:24]** generated by AI or in in like uh uh shaped by I and 15% say that even more

**[01:27]** shaped by I and 15% say that even more

**[01:27]** shaped by I and 15% say that even more than 80 80% of their code uh is

**[01:30]** than 80 80% of their code uh is

**[01:30]** than 80 80% of their code uh is basically generated or or shaped by AI.

**[01:33]** basically generated or or shaped by AI.

**[01:33]** basically generated or or shaped by AI. Now people are using AI to do vibe

**[01:36]** Now people are using AI to do vibe

**[01:36]** Now people are using AI to do vibe coding but actually they're even doing

**[01:39]** coding but actually they're even doing

**[01:39]** coding but actually they're even doing it for vibe checking vibe reviewing.

**[01:42]** it for vibe checking vibe reviewing.

**[01:42]** it for vibe checking vibe reviewing. This is the command of cloud. This is

**[01:45]** This is the command of cloud. This is

**[01:45]** This is the command of cloud. This is the prompt for the command of claude

**[01:47]** the prompt for the command of claude

**[01:47]** the prompt for the command of claude code for security review. It was hyped

**[01:50]** code for security review. It was hyped

**[01:50]** code for security review. It was hyped like two months ago. Do you know what

**[01:51]** like two months ago. Do you know what

**[01:51]** like two months ago. Do you know what I'm talking about now? It says there, I

**[01:53]** I'm talking about now? It says there, I

**[01:53]** I'm talking about now? It says there, I don't know if you see it. Uh you are a

**[01:55]** don't know if you see it. Uh you are a

**[01:55]** don't know if you see it. Uh you are a senior security engineer. Good. And then

**[01:57]** senior security engineer. Good. And then

**[01:57]** senior security engineer. Good. And then like somewhere there uh down the line it


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** like somewhere there uh down the line it

**[02:00]** like somewhere there uh down the line it says please exclude denial of service.

**[02:04]** says please exclude denial of service.

**[02:04]** says please exclude denial of service. Don't don't uh catch denial of service

**[02:06]** Don't don't uh catch denial of service

**[02:06]** Don't don't uh catch denial of service issues. Maybe that's part of the part of

**[02:10]** issues. Maybe that's part of the part of

**[02:10]** issues. Maybe that's part of the part of the reason like we're we're having uh

**[02:12]** the reason like we're we're having uh

**[02:12]** the reason like we're we're having uh cloud outages. probably not just that,

**[02:14]** cloud outages. probably not just that,

**[02:14]** cloud outages. probably not just that, but you get the point. Like we need to

**[02:16]** but you get the point. Like we need to

**[02:16]** but you get the point. Like we need to be rigorous about how we deal with

**[02:19]** be rigorous about how we deal with

**[02:19]** be rigorous about how we deal with quality. It's not just like vibe quality

**[02:21]** quality. It's not just like vibe quality

**[02:21]** quality. It's not just like vibe quality or or so like we're doing vibe coding

**[02:23]** or or so like we're doing vibe coding

**[02:23]** or or so like we're doing vibe coding sometimes. Uh let's go to another

**[02:26]** sometimes. Uh let's go to another

**[02:26]** sometimes. Uh let's go to another example. Okay, cursor I guess like or or

**[02:29]** example. Okay, cursor I guess like or or

**[02:29]** example. Okay, cursor I guess like or or pilot most of you use rules, right?

**[02:31]** pilot most of you use rules, right?

**[02:31]** pilot most of you use rules, right? We're going to talk about it. You invest

**[02:33]** We're going to talk about it. You invest

**[02:33]** We're going to talk about it. You invest in code generation. After a while, you

**[02:35]** in code generation. After a while, you

**[02:35]** in code generation. After a while, you understand if you invest, you'll get

**[02:36]** understand if you invest, you'll get

**[02:36]** understand if you invest, you'll get more out of it. And uh we we asked like

**[02:40]** more out of it. And uh we we asked like

**[02:40]** more out of it. And uh we we asked like a bunch of of developers and I'm asking

**[02:42]** a bunch of of developers and I'm asking

**[02:42]** a bunch of of developers and I'm asking you as well think think for a second for

**[02:44]** you as well think think for a second for

**[02:44]** you as well think think for a second for all the developers there in the audience

**[02:47]** all the developers there in the audience

**[02:47]** all the developers there in the audience like when you write cursor rules or

**[02:49]** like when you write cursor rules or

**[02:49]** like when you write cursor rules or copilot rules etc. Do you feel they're

**[02:51]** copilot rules etc. Do you feel they're

**[02:51]** copilot rules etc. Do you feel they're completely followed or it's like mostly

**[02:54]** completely followed or it's like mostly

**[02:54]** completely followed or it's like mostly followed? Do you know how much they're

**[02:55]** followed? Do you know how much they're

**[02:55]** followed? Do you know how much they're followed? And what extent are they

**[02:57]** followed? And what extent are they

**[02:57]** followed? And what extent are they followed? It's rigorously like how

**[02:58]** followed? It's rigorously like how

**[02:58]** followed? It's rigorously like how technical deep they're they're being


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** technical deep they're they're being

**[03:00]** technical deep they're they're being followed. So the what we get back like

**[03:03]** followed. So the what we get back like

**[03:03]** followed. So the what we get back like the answer from what you see here on the

**[03:04]** the answer from what you see here on the

**[03:04]** the answer from what you see here on the screen is mostly like B, C, and D. They

**[03:07]** screen is mostly like B, C, and D. They

**[03:07]** screen is mostly like B, C, and D. They are followed but they're not completely

**[03:09]** are followed but they're not completely

**[03:09]** are followed but they're not completely followed. Okay. So that means like we

**[03:12]** followed. Okay. So that means like we

**[03:12]** followed. Okay. So that means like we are generating code trying to push it to

**[03:15]** are generating code trying to push it to

**[03:15]** are generating code trying to push it to the standards but it's not necessarily

**[03:17]** the standards but it's not necessarily

**[03:17]** the standards but it's not necessarily still like getting to the quality we

**[03:18]** still like getting to the quality we

**[03:18]** still like getting to the quality we wanted. I'm going to share a bit more

**[03:21]** wanted. I'm going to share a bit more

**[03:21]** wanted. I'm going to share a bit more statistics and and information and some

**[03:23]** statistics and and information and some

**[03:23]** statistics and and information and some insight from three reports. One done by

**[03:26]** insight from three reports. One done by

**[03:26]** insight from three reports. One done by Codo, another by done by Sonar, another

**[03:29]** Codo, another by done by Sonar, another

**[03:29]** Codo, another by done by Sonar, another by far. And all of them are are focused

**[03:32]** by far. And all of them are are focused

**[03:32]** by far. And all of them are are focused on code code quality review etc. The

**[03:35]** on code code quality review etc. The

**[03:35]** on code code quality review etc. The sample size is thousands of developers

**[03:37]** sample size is thousands of developers

**[03:37]** sample size is thousands of developers in some cases even more. Millions of

**[03:39]** in some cases even more. Millions of

**[03:40]** in some cases even more. Millions of pull requests and and a billion of of

**[03:42]** pull requests and and a billion of of

**[03:42]** pull requests and and a billion of of lines lines of code that were uh uh

**[03:45]** lines lines of code that were uh uh

**[03:45]** lines lines of code that were uh uh being checked. Like for example, if you

**[03:47]** being checked. Like for example, if you

**[03:47]** being checked. Like for example, if you think about uh Sonar, this is a company.

**[03:50]** think about uh Sonar, this is a company.

**[03:50]** think about uh Sonar, this is a company. Yeah. A bit like coming from pre-AII,

**[03:53]** Yeah. A bit like coming from pre-AII,

**[03:53]** Yeah. A bit like coming from pre-AII, but they see code at scale and you

**[03:56]** but they see code at scale and you

**[03:56]** but they see code at scale and you they're doing like a lot of uh checks in

**[03:59]** they're doing like a lot of uh checks in

**[03:59]** they're doing like a lot of uh checks in code that are not necessarily AI


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** code that are not necessarily AI

**[04:01]** code that are not necessarily AI focused, but are necessary in order to

**[04:04]** focused, but are necessary in order to

**[04:04]** focused, but are necessary in order to check uh your your software from all

**[04:07]** check uh your your software from all

**[04:07]** check uh your your software from all possible direction. And that's why their

**[04:09]** possible direction. And that's why their

**[04:09]** possible direction. And that's why their scaling and the scale of the code that

**[04:11]** scaling and the scale of the code that

**[04:11]** scaling and the scale of the code that they're seeing is is immense. Okay. So

**[04:13]** they're seeing is is immense. Okay. So

**[04:13]** they're seeing is is immense. Okay. So for example, we took information from

**[04:15]** for example, we took information from

**[04:15]** for example, we took information from from their report and eventually my

**[04:17]** from their report and eventually my

**[04:17]** from their report and eventually my purpose here is to break down the

**[04:19]** purpose here is to break down the

**[04:19]** purpose here is to break down the different dimension of what uh code

**[04:21]** different dimension of what uh code

**[04:22]** different dimension of what uh code quality means and give you some share

**[04:23]** quality means and give you some share

**[04:23]** quality means and give you some share some stats and and insights. I want to

**[04:26]** some stats and and insights. I want to

**[04:26]** some stats and and insights. I want to start with the end. Okay, this is the

**[04:29]** start with the end. Okay, this is the

**[04:30]** start with the end. Okay, this is the takeaway I want you all all like to take

**[04:32]** takeaway I want you all all like to take

**[04:32]** takeaway I want you all all like to take from from the next 13 minutes that I

**[04:34]** from from the next 13 minutes that I

**[04:34]** from from the next 13 minutes that I have. We started with code generation.

**[04:37]** have. We started with code generation.

**[04:37]** have. We started with code generation. We like out of the box use it

**[04:39]** We like out of the box use it

**[04:40]** We like out of the box use it autocomplete etc. and you invest in it

**[04:42]** autocomplete etc. and you invest in it

**[04:42]** autocomplete etc. and you invest in it and you can get more out of it. But

**[04:45]** and you can get more out of it. But

**[04:45]** and you can get more out of it. But there's a glass ceiling for how much

**[04:47]** there's a glass ceiling for how much

**[04:47]** there's a glass ceiling for how much productivity you can get from code

**[04:48]** productivity you can get from code

**[04:48]** productivity you can get from code generation. And then we move to the

**[04:51]** generation. And then we move to the

**[04:51]** generation. And then we move to the agent code generation, right? Let's call

**[04:53]** agent code generation, right? Let's call

**[04:53]** agent code generation, right? Let's call it gen 2.0. And that's a higher glass

**[04:55]** it gen 2.0. And that's a higher glass

**[04:55]** it gen 2.0. And that's a higher glass ceiling. It could do much more

**[04:57]** ceiling. It could do much more

**[04:57]** ceiling. It could do much more productivity and especially if you

**[04:59]** productivity and especially if you

**[04:59]** productivity and especially if you invest in it, for example, rules, etc.


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** invest in it, for example, rules, etc.

**[05:02]** invest in it, for example, rules, etc. Then with AI breaking outside of the

**[05:06]** Then with AI breaking outside of the

**[05:06]** Then with AI breaking outside of the IDE, we can start using AI also for code

**[05:11]** IDE, we can start using AI also for code

**[05:11]** IDE, we can start using AI also for code for agentic quality workflows. It could

**[05:14]** for agentic quality workflows. It could

**[05:14]** for agentic quality workflows. It could be inside the ID, but the the truth is

**[05:16]** be inside the ID, but the the truth is

**[05:16]** be inside the ID, but the the truth is that if you think about all the

**[05:18]** that if you think about all the

**[05:18]** that if you think about all the workflows you have in your organization,

**[05:19]** workflows you have in your organization,

**[05:19]** workflows you have in your organization, especially if you're more than 100

**[05:20]** especially if you're more than 100

**[05:20]** especially if you're more than 100 developers or so, you probably have a

**[05:22]** developers or so, you probably have a

**[05:22]** developers or so, you probably have a lot of workflows that you are related to

**[05:24]** lot of workflows that you are related to

**[05:24]** lot of workflows that you are related to quality that you need to auto automate.

**[05:27]** quality that you need to auto automate.

**[05:27]** quality that you need to auto automate. And that's where you start like breaking

**[05:30]** And that's where you start like breaking

**[05:30]** And that's where you start like breaking through the glass ceiling of

**[05:31]** through the glass ceiling of

**[05:31]** through the glass ceiling of productivity. if you invest in it. And

**[05:33]** productivity. if you invest in it. And

**[05:34]** productivity. if you invest in it. And finally, I I claim that you need those

**[05:36]** finally, I I claim that you need those

**[05:36]** finally, I I claim that you need those agentic workflows. Keep learning. And we

**[05:39]** agentic workflows. Keep learning. And we

**[05:39]** agentic workflows. Keep learning. And we might touch a little bit of that like

**[05:41]** might touch a little bit of that like

**[05:41]** might touch a little bit of that like later later on, okay? Like because

**[05:43]** later later on, okay? Like because

**[05:43]** later later on, okay? Like because quality is something dynamic. So you'll

**[05:46]** quality is something dynamic. So you'll

**[05:46]** quality is something dynamic. So you'll only finally break break the glass

**[05:48]** only finally break break the glass

**[05:48]** only finally break break the glass ceiling if if you really have those

**[05:51]** ceiling if if you really have those

**[05:51]** ceiling if if you really have those quality workflows and rules and standard

**[05:53]** quality workflows and rules and standard

**[05:53]** quality workflows and rules and standard being dynamic. And then then you will

**[05:55]** being dynamic. And then then you will

**[05:55]** being dynamic. And then then you will see the promised 2x, let alone the 10x

**[05:58]** see the promised 2x, let alone the 10x

**[05:58]** see the promised 2x, let alone the 10x that you were promised the hyped. and


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** that you were promised the hyped. and

**[06:00]** that you were promised the hyped. and you you heard from McKenzie and from

**[06:01]** you you heard from McKenzie and from

**[06:01]** you you heard from McKenzie and from Stanford you're not getting that I don't

**[06:03]** Stanford you're not getting that I don't

**[06:03]** Stanford you're not getting that I don't need to tell you that 2x 10x for that

**[06:05]** need to tell you that 2x 10x for that

**[06:06]** need to tell you that 2x 10x for that entire software development uh life

**[06:07]** entire software development uh life

**[06:08]** entire software development uh life cycle so a bit about more about the

**[06:11]** cycle so a bit about more about the

**[06:11]** cycle so a bit about more about the market adoption uh one of the report

**[06:13]** market adoption uh one of the report

**[06:13]** market adoption uh one of the report says that 82% of adoption already for AI

**[06:18]** says that 82% of adoption already for AI

**[06:18]** says that 82% of adoption already for AI dev tools are being used daily or weekly

**[06:21]** dev tools are being used daily or weekly

**[06:21]** dev tools are being used daily or weekly uh some people at 60 60% 59 report that

**[06:24]** uh some people at 60 60% 59 report that

**[06:24]** uh some people at 60 60% 59 report that they're using more than three and 20%

**[06:27]** they're using more than three and 20%

**[06:27]** they're using more than three and 20% saying they're using more than five code

**[06:28]** saying they're using more than five code

**[06:28]** saying they're using more than five code generation tools If you think about it

**[06:30]** generation tools If you think about it

**[06:30]** generation tools If you think about it for a second, uh don't only take like

**[06:32]** for a second, uh don't only take like

**[06:32]** for a second, uh don't only take like cursor copilot, codex, cloud code, etc.

**[06:35]** cursor copilot, codex, cloud code, etc.

**[06:35]** cursor copilot, codex, cloud code, etc. Sorry if I'm insulting anyone in the

**[06:37]** Sorry if I'm insulting anyone in the

**[06:37]** Sorry if I'm insulting anyone in the that I forgot their tool, but there's

**[06:39]** that I forgot their tool, but there's

**[06:39]** that I forgot their tool, but there's also the lovable etc. They also generate

**[06:41]** also the lovable etc. They also generate

**[06:41]** also the lovable etc. They also generate code. And by the way, you're going to

**[06:42]** code. And by the way, you're going to

**[06:42]** code. And by the way, you're going to get to 10. I'm count on me. You're going

**[06:44]** get to 10. I'm count on me. You're going

**[06:44]** get to 10. I'm count on me. You're going to get to 10 tools in two three years

**[06:47]** to get to 10 tools in two three years

**[06:47]** to get to 10 tools in two three years that generate code for you. Okay, come

**[06:49]** that generate code for you. Okay, come

**[06:49]** that generate code for you. Okay, come to talk to me about later. I'll try to

**[06:50]** to talk to me about later. I'll try to

**[06:50]** to talk to me about later. I'll try to convince you. And and the thing is that

**[06:53]** convince you. And and the thing is that

**[06:53]** convince you. And and the thing is that it it's coming from bottom up. like 50%

**[06:55]** it it's coming from bottom up. like 50%

**[06:55]** it it's coming from bottom up. like 50% of the usage is coming from less than 10

**[06:58]** of the usage is coming from less than 10

**[06:58]** of the usage is coming from less than 10 teams that are less than 10 developers


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** teams that are less than 10 developers

**[07:00]** teams that are less than 10 developers but it is propagating also to the

**[07:02]** but it is propagating also to the

**[07:02]** but it is propagating also to the enterprise again I'm sure you know I

**[07:04]** enterprise again I'm sure you know I

**[07:08]** at scale like not just like five developers in the last year we're seeing

**[07:09]** developers in the last year we're seeing

**[07:10]** developers in the last year we're seeing like more and more enterprise using co

**[07:11]** like more and more enterprise using co

**[07:11]** like more and more enterprise using co code generation u so if like an average

**[07:16]** code generation u so if like an average

**[07:16]** code generation u so if like an average with within reports we saw 82 to 92%

**[07:19]** with within reports we saw 82 to 92%

**[07:19]** with within reports we saw 82 to 92% using weekly to a monthly uh code

**[07:22]** using weekly to a monthly uh code

**[07:22]** using weekly to a monthly uh code generation tools and in some cases Maybe

**[07:26]** extreme, maybe not. We're going to talk

**[07:26]** extreme, maybe not. We're going to talk about it. We saw 3x productivity boost

**[07:30]** about it. We saw 3x productivity boost

**[07:30]** about it. We saw 3x productivity boost in writing code. Okay, but that doesn't

**[07:33]** in writing code. Okay, but that doesn't

**[07:33]** in writing code. Okay, but that doesn't mean that if you have uh 3x productivity

**[07:35]** mean that if you have uh 3x productivity

**[07:35]** mean that if you have uh 3x productivity in writing code that you actually

**[07:37]** in writing code that you actually

**[07:37]** in writing code that you actually guarantee any quality like I presented

**[07:39]** guarantee any quality like I presented

**[07:39]** guarantee any quality like I presented before. So actually 67% of the developer

**[07:42]** before. So actually 67% of the developer

**[07:42]** before. So actually 67% of the developer that we ask asked have serious quality

**[07:46]** that we ask asked have serious quality

**[08:00]** to measure quality. It's a big question. What is quality? I'm going to talk about

**[08:02]** What is quality? I'm going to talk about

**[08:02]** What is quality? I'm going to talk about it in the next few slides. Okay, think

**[08:04]** it in the next few slides. Okay, think

**[08:04]** it in the next few slides. Okay, think about it for a second before I break

**[08:06]** about it for a second before I break

**[08:06]** about it for a second before I break break it down. What what is quality? Um

**[08:09]** break it down. What what is quality? Um

**[08:09]** break it down. What what is quality? Um so what we're actually saying that the

**[08:11]** so what we're actually saying that the

**[08:11]** so what we're actually saying that the crisis with V right coding uh viable

**[08:14]** crisis with V right coding uh viable coding we're seeing it shifting and

**[08:15]** coding we're seeing it shifting and

**[08:15]** coding we're seeing it shifting and evolving is that you're getting like

**[08:18]** evolving is that you're getting like

**[08:18]** evolving is that you're getting like more task being done like 20 some report

**[08:30]** 97 more% or so of PRs being opened and

**[08:30]** 97 more% or so of PRs being opened and eventually it takes more time to review

**[08:32]** eventually it takes more time to review

**[08:32]** eventually it takes more time to review PR like 90% more time to review PR and

**[08:35]** PR like 90% more time to review PR and

**[12:57]** one thing. The ne next suspect to help

**[12:57]** one thing. The ne next suspect to help us with the quality is code review. What


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** us with the quality is code review. What

**[13:00]** us with the quality is code review. What really interesting about code review

**[13:01]** really interesting about code review

**[13:01]** really interesting about code review that it's a process that helps almost

**[13:04]** that it's a process that helps almost

**[13:04]** that it's a process that helps almost with all the process level and the code

**[13:07]** with all the process level and the code

**[13:07]** with all the process level and the code level like issues. For example, you can

**[13:10]** level like issues. For example, you can

**[13:10]** level like issues. For example, you can set your AI code review tool to tell you

**[13:12]** set your AI code review tool to tell you

**[13:12]** set your AI code review tool to tell you block this PR if it doesn't cover

**[13:15]** block this PR if it doesn't cover

**[13:15]** block this PR if it doesn't cover certain level of test coverage. So

**[13:18]** certain level of test coverage. So

**[13:18]** certain level of test coverage. So through the PR you take care of the

**[13:21]** through the PR you take care of the

**[13:21]** through the PR you take care of the testing process problem. Okay. So code

**[13:23]** testing process problem. Okay. So code

**[13:24]** testing process problem. Okay. So code like code review with AI is actually one

**[13:26]** like code review with AI is actually one

**[13:26]** like code review with AI is actually one of one of the major things you you you

**[13:28]** of one of the major things you you you

**[13:28]** of one of the major things you you you can do and people that are developers

**[13:31]** can do and people that are developers

**[13:31]** can do and people that are developers that are using AI code review tool

**[13:33]** that are using AI code review tool

**[13:33]** that are using AI code review tool they're saying that they're saying

**[13:34]** they're saying that they're saying

**[13:44]** helps them to uh improve improve 47% in

**[13:44]** helps them to uh improve improve 47% in productivity of writing code. Okay. Now

**[13:48]** productivity of writing code. Okay. Now

**[13:48]** productivity of writing code. Okay. Now a bit statistics from our own uh AI code

**[13:51]** a bit statistics from our own uh AI code

**[13:51]** a bit statistics from our own uh AI code review tool. We scan a million of PRs a

**[13:53]** review tool. We scan a million of PRs a

**[14:03]** the way, we're now analyzing uh before

**[14:03]** the way, we're now analyzing uh before and after using AI. I don't have that

**[14:04]** and after using AI. I don't have that

**[14:21]** to talk to you like about uh when you're

**[14:22]** to talk to you like about uh when you're trying to improve on quality is is the

**[14:24]** trying to improve on quality is is the

**[14:24]** trying to improve on quality is is the foundation of having the right context

**[14:27]** foundation of having the right context

**[14:27]** foundation of having the right context that is brought to the uh code

**[14:29]** that is brought to the uh code

**[14:30]** that is brought to the uh code generation tool that is brought to the

**[14:31]** generation tool that is brought to the

**[14:32]** generation tool that is brought to the AI code review tool better context

**[14:34]** AI code review tool better context

**[14:34]** AI code review tool better context better quality across the board wherever

**[14:36]** better quality across the board wherever

**[14:36]** better quality across the board wherever you're using AI. Uh so when we asked

**[14:38]** you're using AI. Uh so when we asked

**[14:38]** you're using AI. Uh so when we asked developers when when you h when you

**[14:41]** developers when when you h when you

**[14:41]** developers when when you h when you don't trust AI generated code like you

**[14:43]** don't trust AI generated code like you

**[14:43]** don't trust AI generated code like you remember like 67% that like are really

**[14:46]** remember like 67% that like are really

**[14:46]** remember like 67% that like are really worried about that they said 80 80% of

**[14:49]** worried about that they said 80 80% of

**[14:49]** worried about that they said 80 80% of the time they don't trust the context

**[14:51]** the time they don't trust the context

**[14:52]** the time they don't trust the context that the LLM have okay and and and uh

**[14:55]** that the LLM have okay and and and uh

**[14:55]** that the LLM have okay and and and uh when we asked developers what would you

**[14:57]** when we asked developers what would you

**[14:58]** when we asked developers what would you like to be improved in your AI generated


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** like to be improved in your AI generated

**[15:00]** like to be improved in your AI generated code in your AI code review tool they

**[15:03]** code in your AI code review tool they

**[15:03]** code in your AI code review tool they said the number one was context it was

**[15:05]** said the number one was context it was

**[15:05]** said the number one was context it was number one of 33% they can choose among

**[15:07]** number one of 33% they can choose among

**[15:07]** number one of 33% they can choose among many things to to improve. So context is

**[15:10]** many things to to improve. So context is

**[15:10]** many things to to improve. So context is extremely important. I can tell you that

**[15:12]** extremely important. I can tell you that

**[15:12]** extremely important. I can tell you that as Kodto one of our technology moes uh

**[15:15]** as Kodto one of our technology moes uh

**[15:15]** as Kodto one of our technology moes uh is is around context and when you

**[15:17]** is is around context and when you

**[15:17]** is is around context and when you connect our context engine we're seeing

**[15:19]** connect our context engine we're seeing

**[15:19]** connect our context engine we're seeing it as the number one tool that is being

**[15:21]** it as the number one tool that is being

**[15:21]** it as the number one tool that is being used like 60% of code generator or code

**[15:24]** used like 60% of code generator or code

**[15:24]** used like 60% of code generator or code review tools 60% of their calls to an

**[15:27]** review tools 60% of their calls to an

**[15:27]** review tools 60% of their calls to an MCP would be to a context MCP. Okay. And

**[15:31]** MCP would be to a context MCP. Okay. And

**[15:31]** MCP would be to a context MCP. Okay. And just to tell you the context doesn't

**[15:33]** just to tell you the context doesn't

**[15:33]** just to tell you the context doesn't necessarily need to include only your

**[15:35]** necessarily need to include only your

**[15:35]** necessarily need to include only your code. It could also include context to

**[15:37]** code. It could also include context to

**[15:37]** code. It could also include context to your standards, your best practices.

**[15:39]** your standards, your best practices.

**[15:39]** your standards, your best practices. We're seeing in our AI code review that

**[15:41]** We're seeing in our AI code review that

**[15:41]** We're seeing in our AI code review that 8% of the context usage is actually from

**[15:44]** 8% of the context usage is actually from

**[15:44]** 8% of the context usage is actually from files that are related to standards and

**[15:46]** files that are related to standards and

**[15:46]** files that are related to standards and and best practices etc. Okay, I have to

**[15:50]** and best practices etc. Okay, I have to

**[15:50]** and best practices etc. Okay, I have to CEO of Kodo like marketing will be mad

**[15:52]** CEO of Kodo like marketing will be mad

**[15:52]** CEO of Kodo like marketing will be mad on me if I don't brag a little bit.

**[15:53]** on me if I don't brag a little bit.

**[15:53]** on me if I don't brag a little bit. Right? So this is uh kind of like our

**[15:56]** Right? So this is uh kind of like our

**[15:56]** Right? So this is uh kind of like our market of our context engine being

**[15:59]** market of our context engine being

**[15:59]** market of our context engine being presented by Jensen and GTC keynote and


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:01]** presented by Jensen and GTC keynote and

**[18:09]** run and and run validation and quality

**[18:09]** run and and run validation and quality uh workflows. So don't don't forget like

**[18:13]** uh workflows. So don't don't forget like

**[18:13]** uh workflows. So don't don't forget like the path forward is quality is your

**[18:15]** the path forward is quality is your

**[18:15]** the path forward is quality is your competitive edge over your uh

**[18:19]** competitive edge over your uh

**[18:19]** competitive edge over your uh competition. AI is a tool. It's not it's

**[18:22]** competition. AI is a tool. It's not it's

**[18:25]** not a solution. Okay? And don't like

**[18:25]** not a solution. Okay? And don't like only think about code generation as the

**[18:26]** only think about code generation as the

**[18:26]** only think about code generation as the only thing. Look on the entire SDLC or

**[18:29]** only thing. Look on the entire SDLC or

**[18:29]** only thing. Look on the entire SDLC or product development life cycle. I saw

**[18:31]** product development life cycle. I saw

**[18:31]** product development life cycle. I saw one of the uh people talked um speakers

**[18:35]** one of the uh people talked um speakers

**[18:35]** one of the uh people talked um speakers and it iterate with everything we talked

**[18:37]** and it iterate with everything we talked

**[18:37]** and it iterate with everything we talked about today. I have uh I want to tell

**[18:40]** about today. I have uh I want to tell

**[18:40]** about today. I have uh I want to tell you that you will gain value from it.

**[18:43]** you that you will gain value from it.

**[18:43]** you that you will gain value from it. We're seeing in the reports people

**[18:45]** We're seeing in the reports people

**[18:45]** We're seeing in the reports people seeing like security availability being

**[18:47]** seeing like security availability being

**[18:47]** seeing like security availability being reduced faster code review you we just

**[18:50]** reduced faster code review you we just

**[18:50]** reduced faster code review you we just got a hit on that because of a generated

**[18:51]** got a hit on that because of a generated

**[18:52]** got a hit on that because of a generated code and test coverage in a month can

**[18:54]** code and test coverage in a month can

**[18:54]** code and test coverage in a month can can triple depends on on the project

**[18:57]** can triple depends on on the project

**[18:57]** can triple depends on on the project etc. with with the last minute I want to

**[18:59]** etc. with with the last minute I want to

**[18:59]** etc. with with the last minute I want to show like a really small piece of what


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:01]** show like a really small piece of what

**[19:01]** show like a really small piece of what you can do with codo. uh you can go into

**[19:04]** you can do with codo. uh you can go into

**[19:04]** you can do with codo. uh you can go into codto and define your own rule for

**[19:07]** codto and define your own rule for

**[19:07]** codto and define your own rule for example almost the same rule you'll put

**[19:09]** example almost the same rule you'll put

**[19:09]** example almost the same rule you'll put on cursor of I don't like nested ifs if

**[19:12]** on cursor of I don't like nested ifs if

**[19:12]** on cursor of I don't like nested ifs if this is a problem that you have but then

**[19:14]** this is a problem that you have but then

**[19:14]** this is a problem that you have but then kodto will look on your context build

**[19:17]** kodto will look on your context build

**[19:17]** kodto will look on your context build the good example the bad example and

**[19:19]** the good example the bad example and

**[19:19]** the good example the bad example and then start giving like building a

**[19:21]** then start giving like building a

**[19:21]** then start giving like building a workflow that is specifically to catch

**[19:24]** workflow that is specifically to catch

**[19:24]** workflow that is specifically to catch that issue and give you statistics over

**[19:27]** that issue and give you statistics over

**[19:27]** that issue and give you statistics over time when it's being accepted and when

**[19:30]** time when it's being accepted and when

**[19:30]** time when it's being accepted and when not so you can adjust that rule and

**[19:32]** not so you can adjust that rule and

**[19:32]** not so you can adjust that rule and really know and have visibility to to

**[19:35]** really know and have visibility to to

**[19:35]** really know and have visibility to to your standards. Okay. So when a PR is

**[19:38]** your standards. Okay. So when a PR is

**[19:38]** your standards. Okay. So when a PR is written with a few ifs and else although

**[19:41]** written with a few ifs and else although

**[19:41]** written with a few ifs and else although it was written with cursor copilot that

**[19:43]** it was written with cursor copilot that

**[19:43]** it was written with cursor copilot that had a rule do not do nested ifs etc.

**[19:47]** had a rule do not do nested ifs etc.

**[19:47]** had a rule do not do nested ifs etc. then eventually when you open a PR you

**[19:49]** then eventually when you open a PR you

**[19:49]** then eventually when you open a PR you will get uh codo uh uh catching that and

**[19:53]** will get uh codo uh uh catching that and

**[19:53]** will get uh codo uh uh catching that and giving a suggestion according to the

**[19:55]** giving a suggestion according to the

**[19:55]** giving a suggestion according to the good and the bad example. COD will also

**[19:57]** good and the bad example. COD will also

**[19:57]** good and the bad example. COD will also make a graph, give you a CLI checks like


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:00]** make a graph, give you a CLI checks like

**[20:00]** make a graph, give you a CLI checks like check each one of the rules and

**[20:02]** check each one of the rules and

**[20:02]** check each one of the rules and eventually tell you the nested if and

**[20:05]** eventually tell you the nested if and

**[20:05]** eventually tell you the nested if and then we'll record and learn what you did

**[20:07]** then we'll record and learn what you did

**[20:07]** then we'll record and learn what you did or did not do with that suggestion in

**[20:10]** or did not do with that suggestion in

**[20:10]** or did not do with that suggestion in order to adapt the standard and of the

**[20:12]** order to adapt the standard and of the

**[20:12]** order to adapt the standard and of the of the quality. Um there will also

**[20:14]** of the quality. Um there will also

**[20:14]** of the quality. Um there will also automated like suggestion. You don't

**[20:16]** automated like suggestion. You don't

**[20:16]** automated like suggestion. You don't need to write your own. It learns your

**[20:18]** need to write your own. It learns your

**[20:18]** need to write your own. It learns your your your standards and quality and

**[20:20]** your your standards and quality and

**[20:20]** your your standards and quality and offer that to you. And that's it. I'm

**[20:22]** offer that to you. And that's it. I'm

**[20:22]** offer that to you. And that's it. I'm I'm really really excited about like

**[20:25]** I'm really really excited about like

**[20:25]** I'm really really excited about like breaking the glass ceiling, okay, with

**[20:27]** breaking the glass ceiling, okay, with

**[20:27]** breaking the glass ceiling, okay, with what we did with code generation and

**[20:29]** what we did with code generation and

**[20:29]** what we did with code generation and then a jet to code generation. Now we're

**[20:32]** then a jet to code generation. Now we're

**[20:32]** then a jet to code generation. Now we're turning into the era of putting AI into

**[20:35]** turning into the era of putting AI into

**[20:35]** turning into the era of putting AI into work and through the entire SDLC. The

**[20:38]** work and through the entire SDLC. The

**[20:38]** work and through the entire SDLC. The most important part is related to

**[20:40]** most important part is related to

**[20:40]** most important part is related to quality. You would need to invest in

**[20:42]** quality. You would need to invest in

**[20:42]** quality. You would need to invest in that. It's not out of the box. Okay. And

**[20:45]** that. It's not out of the box. Okay. And

**[20:45]** that. It's not out of the box. Okay. And then you would see eventually the

**[20:46]** then you would see eventually the

**[20:46]** then you would see eventually the promised 2x that that probably promised

**[20:51]** promised 2x that that probably promised

**[20:51]** promised 2x that that probably promised to the CEO or something like that once

**[20:53]** to the CEO or something like that once

**[20:53]** to the CEO or something like that once they give you the budget for for the
