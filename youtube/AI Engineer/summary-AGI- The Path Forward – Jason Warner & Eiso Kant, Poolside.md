## Executive Summary

Jason Warner (former CTO of GitHub) and Eiso Kant present Poolside, a company building AI models from scratch to close the gap between models and human intelligence. They demonstrate their "Malibu agent" - a second-generation coding assistant that converts legacy Ada code to Rust and adds new features. Poolside has been working with government and defense contractors for the past year on high-consequence code environments. The company is training models using proprietary techniques combining next token prediction with reinforcement learning, with over 40,000 GB300s coming online for their next-generation model launching early next year.

- Poolside's mission: close the gap between models and human intelligence
- Building proprietary models from scratch (not using OpenAI or Anthropic)
- Founded 2.5 years ago on the belief that next token prediction + reinforcement learning was key
- Currently on second-generation model: Malibu agent

**Key Points:**
- Proprietary training techniques combining next token prediction and RL
- Full vertical stack from data centers to user interface

- Demonstrating conversion of Ada (legacy government language) to Rust
- Agent writes 1,152 lines of code
- Agent automatically tests the conversion
- Shows live diff view of all changes across multiple files

**Key Points:**
- Fast inference speed
- Agent autonomously creates test commands
- Successful database operations after conversion

### [Feature Addition Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGCG_QkCcZo&t=368s)
**Start:** 06:08 | **End:** 07:59

- Request to add up-arrow command history cycling
- Agent identifies appropriate Rust library (rusty line)
- Automatically updates dependencies and code
- Creates bash script to test the new feature
- Successfully builds and verifies functionality

**Key Points:**
- Agent selects appropriate libraries autonomously
- Handles end-to-end implementation including testing
- Successfully adds terminal history navigation

### [Defense & Government Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGCG_QkCcZo&t=198s)

### [Origin Story: GitHub Acquisition Attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGCG_QkCcZo&t=762s)
**Start:** 12:42 | **End:** 14:15

- Jason tried to acquire Eiso's company at GitHub in 2017
- Eiso had working code completion on LSTMs before transformers
- Acquisition failed, but they became close friends
- Reunited in 2022 after ChatGPT launch to found Poolside
- Eiso initially said "god damn no" to starting a company

**Key Points:**
- Long history of collaboration on AI for coding
- Early belief in neural networks for software development
- Decision to jump back in after seeing ChatGPT/Anthropic progress

### [Technical Philosophy: Reinforcement Learning Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGCG_QkCcZo&t=861s)
**Start:** 14:21 | **End:** 15:35

- Contrarian bet on RL + LLMs in first 18 months
- Now mainstream approach for advancing capabilities
- Evolution from completions → chat → agents → autonomous systems
- Focus on bridging raw intelligence to economically valuable work
- "Awkward teenage years" before AGI

**Key Points:**
- Reinforcement learning combined with language models
- Increasingly autonomous agent capabilities
- Tasks running for hours, soon days, eventually longer
- Combination of capable models + real-world problems
- Full vertical integration strategy

### [Partnership Opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGCG_QkCcZo&t=701s)
**Start:** 11:40 | **End:** 12:25

- Open to partnerships for fine-tuning and additional RL on their models
- Alternative to current open-source models (Qwen, DeepSeek, Minimax)
- Willing to provide early checkpoints for collaboration
- Seeking builders to work closely with them
- "World built on top of intelligence"

**Key Points:**
- Partnership model not fully defined yet
