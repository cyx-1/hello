### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:01]** have been doing open source work uh for

**[12:01]** have been doing open source work uh for me personally it's been like five or six

**[12:03]** me personally it's been like five or six

**[12:03]** me personally it's been like five or six years now. Um open source products are

**[12:05]** years now. Um open source products are

**[12:05]** years now. Um open source products are interesting because they are used by

**[12:07]** interesting because they are used by

**[12:07]** interesting because they are used by both like a random indiv individual

**[12:09]** both like a random indiv individual

**[12:09]** both like a random indiv individual hobbyists that just want something that

**[12:11]** hobbyists that just want something that

**[12:11]** hobbyists that just want something that they can use uh that's simple and free

**[12:13]** they can use uh that's simple and free

**[12:13]** they can use uh that's simple and free and whatever. Uh but also open source

**[12:17]** and whatever. Uh but also open source

**[12:17]** and whatever. Uh but also open source projects are some of the best choices

**[12:19]** projects are some of the best choices

**[12:19]** projects are some of the best choices for like mega enterprise companies,

**[12:21]** for like mega enterprise companies,

**[12:21]** for like mega enterprise companies, right? These giant companies uh

**[12:24]** right? These giant companies uh

**[12:24]** right? These giant companies uh typically want to run everything

**[12:25]** typically want to run everything

**[12:25]** typically want to run everything themselves. They want to host everything

**[12:26]** themselves. They want to host everything

**[12:26]** themselves. They want to host everything themselves. They're very sensitive about

**[12:29]** themselves. They're very sensitive about

**[12:29]** themselves. They're very sensitive about uh data going anywhere else. Uh so open

**[12:31]** uh data going anywhere else. Uh so open

**[12:31]** uh data going anywhere else. Uh so open source projects have this requirement of

**[12:34]** source projects have this requirement of

**[12:34]** source projects have this requirement of supporting both like the really simple

**[12:36]** supporting both like the really simple

**[12:36]** supporting both like the really simple case and both the really advanced case.

**[12:38]** case and both the really advanced case.

**[12:38]** case and both the really advanced case. Uh the way we go about this is there's

**[12:41]** Uh the way we go about this is there's

**[12:41]** Uh the way we go about this is there's kind of this there's like this I would

**[12:43]** kind of this there's like this I would

**[12:44]** kind of this there's like this I would say misconception that products can

**[12:45]** say misconception that products can

**[12:45]** say misconception that products can either be simple or they can be capable

**[12:48]** either be simple or they can be capable

**[12:48]** either be simple or they can be capable and they'll say like oh we're like Apple

**[12:51]** and they'll say like oh we're like Apple

**[12:51]** and they'll say like oh we're like Apple we're building a simple experience but

**[12:52]** we're building a simple experience but

**[12:52]** we're building a simple experience but what they're usually doing is just

**[12:54]** what they're usually doing is just

**[12:54]** what they're usually doing is just building an incapable experience and

**[12:55]** building an incapable experience and

**[12:55]** building an incapable experience and they're saying that oh we're like Apple

**[12:57]** they're saying that oh we're like Apple

**[12:58]** they're saying that oh we're like Apple cuz it's the simple experience. There's


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** cuz it's the simple experience. There's

**[13:00]** cuz it's the simple experience. There's actually no trade-off between these two

**[13:01]** actually no trade-off between these two

**[13:01]** actually no trade-off between these two things. You can build both a simple and

**[13:04]** things. You can build both a simple and

**[13:04]** things. You can build both a simple and capable experience. Uh the way to do

**[13:07]** capable experience. Uh the way to do

**[13:07]** capable experience. Uh the way to do this, it's just it's just more work up

**[13:09]** this, it's just it's just more work up

**[13:09]** this, it's just it's just more work up front, right? You think about a feature

**[13:11]** front, right? You think about a feature

**[13:11]** front, right? You think about a feature you want to build that uh makes a lot of

**[13:13]** you want to build that uh makes a lot of

**[13:13]** you want to build that uh makes a lot of sense for users. Instead of building the

**[13:15]** sense for users. Instead of building the

**[13:15]** sense for users. Instead of building the feature, you kind of have to build

**[13:17]** feature, you kind of have to build

**[13:17]** feature, you kind of have to build primitives that can be assembled into

**[13:19]** primitives that can be assembled into

**[13:19]** primitives that can be assembled into that feature. So you think about the

**[13:21]** that feature. So you think about the

**[13:21]** that feature. So you think about the primitive layers first, make them uh

**[13:24]** primitive layers first, make them uh

**[13:24]** primitive layers first, make them uh pretty wide scoping, u make them really

**[13:27]** pretty wide scoping, u make them really

**[13:27]** pretty wide scoping, u make them really advanced, really powerful. Then you take

**[13:29]** advanced, really powerful. Then you take

**[13:30]** advanced, really powerful. Then you take those primitives and assemble your

**[13:31]** those primitives and assemble your

**[13:31]** those primitives and assemble your simple experience that 99% of people

**[13:34]** simple experience that 99% of people

**[13:34]** simple experience that 99% of people experience. Uh the what the nice thing

**[13:37]** experience. Uh the what the nice thing

**[13:37]** experience. Uh the what the nice thing about doing it in this order is when

**[13:39]** about doing it in this order is when

**[13:40]** about doing it in this order is when they get more complex, you can give them

**[13:42]** they get more complex, you can give them

**[13:42]** they get more complex, you can give them more direct access to these underlying

**[13:43]** more direct access to these underlying

**[13:43]** more direct access to these underlying primitives. They can get more advanced.

**[13:46]** primitives. They can get more advanced.

**[13:46]** primitives. They can get more advanced. They can flex and bend your product and

**[13:48]** They can flex and bend your product and

**[13:48]** They can flex and bend your product and hopefully they never need to outgrow it,

**[13:50]** hopefully they never need to outgrow it,

**[13:50]** hopefully they never need to outgrow it, right? Because the key here is you don't

**[13:51]** right? Because the key here is you don't

**[13:51]** right? Because the key here is you don't want to build a product that people

**[13:53]** want to build a product that people

**[13:53]** want to build a product that people outgrow. uh because you're effectively

**[13:55]** outgrow. uh because you're effectively

**[13:55]** outgrow. uh because you're effectively serving as a funnel for someone else's

**[13:57]** serving as a funnel for someone else's

**[13:57]** serving as a funnel for someone else's product, whatever they whatever they

**[13:58]** product, whatever they whatever they

**[13:58]** product, whatever they whatever they outgrow into. Uh so I really like


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** outgrow into. Uh so I really like

**[14:01]** outgrow into. Uh so I really like building things where think about like

**[14:04]** building things where think about like

**[14:04]** building things where think about like everything we ever want to do and build

**[14:06]** everything we ever want to do and build

**[14:06]** everything we ever want to do and build a set of primitives that can eventually

**[14:08]** a set of primitives that can eventually

**[14:08]** a set of primitives that can eventually do those things and assemble our product

**[14:09]** do those things and assemble our product

**[14:10]** do those things and assemble our product using those primitives. Uh this is

**[14:12]** using those primitives. Uh this is

**[14:12]** using those primitives. Uh this is another area where AI does not really

**[14:14]** another area where AI does not really

**[14:14]** another area where AI does not really help me because

**[14:17]** help me because

**[14:17]** help me because it's like so hard, right? the building

**[14:20]** it's like so hard, right? the building

**[14:20]** it's like so hard, right? the building and trying to build these set of

**[14:22]** and trying to build these set of

**[14:22]** and trying to build these set of primitives is how you even figure out

**[14:23]** primitives is how you even figure out

**[14:23]** primitives is how you even figure out what primitives to need primitives you

**[14:25]** what primitives to need primitives you

**[14:25]** what primitives to need primitives you need and what you're trying to do. uh

**[14:27]** need and what you're trying to do. uh

**[14:27]** need and what you're trying to do. uh that exploration process like sure you

**[14:29]** that exploration process like sure you

**[14:29]** that exploration process like sure you can like again chat with AI brainstorm

**[14:31]** can like again chat with AI brainstorm

**[14:31]** can like again chat with AI brainstorm but this isn't the type of thing that

**[14:34]** but this isn't the type of thing that

**[14:34]** but this isn't the type of thing that like you to even like communicate to AI

**[14:37]** like you to even like communicate to AI

**[14:37]** like you to even like communicate to AI what you want to do you have to

**[14:38]** what you want to do you have to

**[14:38]** what you want to do you have to understand it really well yourself and

**[14:40]** understand it really well yourself and

**[14:40]** understand it really well yourself and that's a task a task is to understand

**[14:41]** that's a task a task is to understand

**[14:41]** that's a task a task is to understand what you're trying to do really really

**[14:43]** what you're trying to do really really

**[14:43]** what you're trying to do really really well uh so this is a again a very

**[14:46]** well uh so this is a again a very

**[14:46]** well uh so this is a again a very critical part of making a successful

**[14:48]** critical part of making a successful

**[14:48]** critical part of making a successful product um

**[14:51]** product um

**[14:51]** product um AI is not going to suddenly make you

**[14:53]** AI is not going to suddenly make you

**[14:53]** AI is not going to suddenly make you amazing at it just it you just can't it

**[14:55]** amazing at it just it you just can't it

**[14:55]** amazing at it just it you just can't it takes a lot of work, time, energy, uh,


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** takes a lot of work, time, energy, uh,

**[15:00]** takes a lot of work, time, energy, uh, until your brain can wrap its head

**[15:01]** until your brain can wrap its head

**[15:01]** until your brain can wrap its head around the space you're working to

**[15:03]** around the space you're working to

**[15:03]** around the space you're working to design the right set of primitives that

**[15:04]** design the right set of primitives that

**[15:04]** design the right set of primitives that can kind of scale to to all these

**[15:06]** can kind of scale to to all these

**[15:06]** can kind of scale to to all these situations. All right, so the last thing

**[15:08]** situations. All right, so the last thing

**[15:08]** situations. All right, so the last thing I'll leave you all with is if you go and

**[15:10]** I'll leave you all with is if you go and

**[15:10]** I'll leave you all with is if you go and try out Open Code, uh, and you go

**[15:12]** try out Open Code, uh, and you go

**[15:12]** try out Open Code, uh, and you go through the full process that I just

**[15:13]** through the full process that I just

**[15:13]** through the full process that I just talked about, you're going to find a lot

**[15:15]** talked about, you're going to find a lot

**[15:15]** talked about, you're going to find a lot to criticize. You're going to be like,

**[15:16]** to criticize. You're going to be like,

**[15:16]** to criticize. You're going to be like, he's not following his own advice here,

**[15:18]** he's not following his own advice here,

**[15:18]** he's not following his own advice here, here, and here. And the reason that's

**[15:20]** here, and here. And the reason that's

**[15:20]** here, and here. And the reason that's happening is even though I can

**[15:22]** happening is even though I can

**[15:22]** happening is even though I can understand all this stuff and to the

**[15:24]** understand all this stuff and to the

**[15:24]** understand all this stuff and to the degree where I can talk about it and

**[15:26]** degree where I can talk about it and

**[15:26]** degree where I can talk about it and articulate it, it's just hard. It's very

**[15:29]** articulate it, it's just hard. It's very

**[15:29]** articulate it, it's just hard. It's very hard to follow this advice. It's simple

**[15:32]** hard to follow this advice. It's simple

**[15:32]** hard to follow this advice. It's simple to understand, I think. But executing it

**[15:34]** to understand, I think. But executing it

**[15:34]** to understand, I think. But executing it well daytoday,

**[15:36]** well daytoday,

**[15:36]** well daytoday, there's no getting around the fact that

**[15:38]** there's no getting around the fact that

**[15:38]** there's no getting around the fact that it's enormously difficult and it takes

**[15:40]** it's enormously difficult and it takes

**[15:40]** it's enormously difficult and it takes so much out of a person, a team to line

**[15:44]** so much out of a person, a team to line

**[15:44]** so much out of a person, a team to line everything up to get it all working

**[15:46]** everything up to get it all working

**[15:46]** everything up to get it all working perfectly right. Uh AI is amazing and

**[15:50]** perfectly right. Uh AI is amazing and

**[15:50]** perfectly right. Uh AI is amazing and lets us do all kinds of things that we

**[15:52]** lets us do all kinds of things that we

**[15:52]** lets us do all kinds of things that we couldn't do before. Does not save us

**[15:55]** couldn't do before. Does not save us

**[15:55]** couldn't do before. Does not save us from that day-to-day pain uh in trying

**[15:58]** from that day-to-day pain uh in trying

**[15:58]** from that day-to-day pain uh in trying to make something that's great. So yeah,


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:02]** to make something that's great. So yeah,

**[16:02]** to make something that's great. So yeah, I wanted to do a talk that was about AI,

**[16:04]** I wanted to do a talk that was about AI,

**[16:04]** I wanted to do a talk that was about AI, but kind of I'm tired of people feeling

**[16:06]** but kind of I'm tired of people feeling

**[16:06]** but kind of I'm tired of people feeling like suddenly the tables are going to

**[16:08]** like suddenly the tables are going to

**[16:08]** like suddenly the tables are going to turn and things are going to be easier.

**[16:10]** turn and things are going to be easier.

**[16:10]** turn and things are going to be easier. They're not easier. My life is just as

**[16:12]** They're not easier. My life is just as

**[16:12]** They're not easier. My life is just as hard as it's ever been. It's just as

**[16:14]** hard as it's ever been. It's just as

**[16:14]** hard as it's ever been. It's just as hard as it's ever been to do something

**[16:15]** hard as it's ever been to do something

**[16:15]** hard as it's ever been to do something amazing. But it's also where all the fun

**[16:18]** amazing. But it's also where all the fun

**[16:18]** amazing. But it's also where all the fun comes from, where all the purpose comes

**[16:20]** comes from, where all the purpose comes

**[16:20]** comes from, where all the purpose comes from. And people are worried about like,

**[16:21]** from. And people are worried about like,

**[16:21]** from. And people are worried about like, oh, people are going to like not have

**[16:22]** oh, people are going to like not have

**[16:22]** oh, people are going to like not have any purpose with with AI. Uh, no, that's

**[16:25]** any purpose with with AI. Uh, no, that's

**[16:25]** any purpose with with AI. Uh, no, that's not going to be a problem because, you

**[16:27]** not going to be a problem because, you

**[16:27]** not going to be a problem because, you know, things are just as hard as as they

**[16:28]** know, things are just as hard as as they

**[16:28]** know, things are just as hard as as they ever were. So, I hope that inspires you,

**[16:31]** ever were. So, I hope that inspires you,

**[16:31]** ever were. So, I hope that inspires you, scares you, I don't know, makes you sad,

**[16:33]** scares you, I don't know, makes you sad,

**[16:33]** scares you, I don't know, makes you sad, makes you happy. I don't know how you're

**[16:34]** makes you happy. I don't know how you're

**[16:34]** makes you happy. I don't know how you're going to feel about this, but that's all

**[16:36]** going to feel about this, but that's all

**[16:36]** going to feel about this, but that's all I have. Thanks for thanks for listening.
