**[00:23]** Today I'm excited to talk uh about

**[00:23]** Today I'm excited to talk uh about something a little bit different. So

**[00:24]** something a little bit different. So

**[00:24]** something a little bit different. So right now uh there's been the last

**[00:27]** right now uh there's been the last

**[00:27]** right now uh there's been the last couple of months have been an

**[00:28]** couple of months have been an

**[00:28]** couple of months have been an interesting time in AI. There's been a

**[00:30]** interesting time in AI. There's been a

**[00:30]** interesting time in AI. There's been a sort of surge in the air uh the

**[00:32]** sort of surge in the air uh the

**[00:32]** sort of surge in the air uh the narrative of an AI bubble. A lot of it

**[00:34]** narrative of an AI bubble. A lot of it

**[00:34]** narrative of an AI bubble. A lot of it driven by dubious studies uh like the

**[00:37]** driven by dubious studies uh like the

**[00:37]** driven by dubious studies uh like the MIT report. And so what I wanted to do

**[00:40]** MIT report. And so what I wanted to do

**[00:40]** MIT report. And so what I wanted to do today is get into not so much the

**[00:43]** today is get into not so much the

**[00:43]** today is get into not so much the practice of consulting and transforming

**[00:45]** practice of consulting and transforming

**[00:45]** practice of consulting and transforming but what organizations are actually

**[00:47]** but what organizations are actually

**[00:47]** but what organizations are actually finding value in right now. So for those

**[00:49]** finding value in right now. So for those

**[00:49]** finding value in right now. So for those of you who don't know me, uh there's

**[00:50]** of you who don't know me, uh there's

**[00:50]** of you who don't know me, uh there's kind of two contexts I bring to this

**[00:52]** kind of two contexts I bring to this

**[00:52]** kind of two contexts I bring to this conversation. The first is as the host

**[00:53]** conversation. The first is as the host

**[00:53]** conversation. The first is as the host of the AI daily brief which is a daily

**[00:55]** of the AI daily brief which is a daily

**[00:55]** of the AI daily brief which is a daily uh news analysis podcast about AI. The

**[00:58]** uh news analysis podcast about AI. The

**[00:58]** uh news analysis podcast about AI. The second is as the CEO of super

**[00:59]** second is as the CEO of super

**[00:59]** second is as the CEO of super intelligent which is an AI planning


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** intelligent which is an AI planning

**[01:00]** intelligent which is an AI planning platform. So the different perspectives

**[01:02]** platform. So the different perspectives

**[01:02]** platform. So the different perspectives are sort of very high level macro

**[01:04]** are sort of very high level macro

**[01:04]** are sort of very high level macro thinking about the news that's happening

**[01:05]** thinking about the news that's happening

**[01:06]** thinking about the news that's happening and then a much more kind of ground

**[01:07]** and then a much more kind of ground

**[01:07]** and then a much more kind of ground level view where we're spending a ton of

**[01:09]** level view where we're spending a ton of

**[01:09]** level view where we're spending a ton of time interviewing executives about

**[01:11]** time interviewing executives about

**[01:11]** time interviewing executives about what's going on inside their

**[01:12]** what's going on inside their

**[01:12]** what's going on inside their organizations. And what we're going to

**[01:13]** organizations. And what we're going to

**[01:13]** organizations. And what we're going to talk about is sort of one kind of

**[01:15]** talk about is sort of one kind of

**[01:15]** talk about is sort of one kind of briefly in the first part just the

**[01:17]** briefly in the first part just the

**[01:17]** briefly in the first part just the status of enterprise adoption uh as it

**[01:19]** status of enterprise adoption uh as it

**[01:19]** status of enterprise adoption uh as it currently stands. And two, um, and the

**[01:22]** currently stands. And two, um, and the

**[01:22]** currently stands. And two, um, and the more interesting part is we've been live

**[01:25]** more interesting part is we've been live

**[01:25]** more interesting part is we've been live with a study in in the market for about

**[01:27]** with a study in in the market for about

**[01:27]** with a study in in the market for about a month now collecting self-reported

**[01:29]** a month now collecting self-reported

**[01:29]** a month now collecting self-reported information about ROI around different

**[01:31]** information about ROI around different

**[01:31]** information about ROI around different use cases. And [snorts] this will be the

**[01:33]** use cases. And [snorts] this will be the

**[01:33]** use cases. And [snorts] this will be the first time uh, this week was the first

**[01:34]** first time uh, this week was the first

**[01:34]** first time uh, this week was the first time I did some analysis on it. And so

**[01:36]** time I did some analysis on it. And so

**[01:36]** time I did some analysis on it. And so I'm going to share what people have uh,

**[01:38]** I'm going to share what people have uh,

**[01:38]** I'm going to share what people have uh, what people have told us around the

**[01:39]** what people have told us around the

**[01:39]** what people have told us around the first kind of 2500 or so use cases that

**[01:41]** first kind of 2500 or so use cases that

**[01:42]** first kind of 2500 or so use cases that they've shared. Um, so it should be

**[01:43]** they've shared. Um, so it should be

**[01:43]** they've shared. Um, so it should be pretty pretty interesting stuff. talking

**[01:45]** pretty pretty interesting stuff. talking

**[01:46]** pretty pretty interesting stuff. talking about kind of enterprise AI adoption

**[01:47]** about kind of enterprise AI adoption

**[01:47]** about kind of enterprise AI adoption first. I'll go through this pretty

**[01:48]** first. I'll go through this pretty

**[01:48]** first. I'll go through this pretty quickly because it's um pretty

**[01:50]** quickly because it's um pretty

**[01:50]** quickly because it's um pretty well-known stuff. Uh the short of it is

**[01:52]** well-known stuff. Uh the short of it is

**[01:52]** well-known stuff. Uh the short of it is enterprises are adopting AI uh in in a

**[01:55]** enterprises are adopting AI uh in in a

**[01:55]** enterprises are adopting AI uh in in a growing fashion. Um pretty much everyone

**[01:57]** growing fashion. Um pretty much everyone

**[01:57]** growing fashion. Um pretty much everyone is using it at least a little bit. Uh

**[01:59]** is using it at least a little bit. Uh

**[01:59]** is using it at least a little bit. Uh and increasingly they're using it a lot.


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:01]** and increasingly they're using it a lot.

**[02:01]** and increasingly they're using it a lot. Uh this year I will need to tell none of

**[02:03]** Uh this year I will need to tell none of

**[02:03]** Uh this year I will need to tell none of you that there is a major inflection

**[02:05]** you that there is a major inflection

**[02:05]** you that there is a major inflection around um specifically adoption in the

**[02:08]** around um specifically adoption in the

**[02:08]** around um specifically adoption in the uh coding and software engineering.

**[02:10]** uh coding and software engineering.

**[02:10]** uh coding and software engineering. Right? You saw a huge huge uptick in

**[02:12]** Right? You saw a huge huge uptick in

**[02:12]** Right? You saw a huge huge uptick in this. Um there's a lot that's

**[02:13]** this. Um there's a lot that's

**[02:14]** this. Um there's a lot that's interesting about that from an

**[02:15]** interesting about that from an

**[02:15]** interesting about that from an enterprise perspective because it wasn't

**[02:16]** enterprise perspective because it wasn't

**[02:16]** enterprise perspective because it wasn't just with the software engineering

**[02:17]** just with the software engineering

**[02:17]** just with the software engineering organizations. Other parts of the

**[02:19]** organizations. Other parts of the

**[02:19]** organizations. Other parts of the organization are also now thinking about

**[02:21]** organization are also now thinking about

**[02:21]** organization are also now thinking about how they can communicate with code,

**[02:22]** how they can communicate with code,

**[02:22]** how they can communicate with code, build things with code. Uh but that's a

**[02:24]** build things with code. Uh but that's a

**[02:24]** build things with code. Uh but that's a huge huge theme of this year coming into

**[02:27]** huge huge theme of this year coming into

**[02:27]** huge huge theme of this year coming into 2025. One of the big sort of thoughts

**[02:29]** 2025. One of the big sort of thoughts

**[02:30]** 2025. One of the big sort of thoughts that many people had was that this would

**[02:31]** that many people had was that this would

**[02:31]** that many people had was that this would be the year of agents inside the

**[02:33]** be the year of agents inside the

**[02:33]** be the year of agents inside the enterprise, right? That big chunks of

**[02:34]** enterprise, right? That big chunks of

**[02:34]** enterprise, right? That big chunks of work would get automated away. And on

**[02:36]** work would get automated away. And on

**[02:36]** work would get automated away. And on the one hand, I think it's pretty clear

**[02:38]** the one hand, I think it's pretty clear

**[02:38]** the one hand, I think it's pretty clear that we didn't see some sort of mass

**[02:41]** that we didn't see some sort of mass

**[02:41]** that we didn't see some sort of mass shift towards automation uh at large

**[02:44]** shift towards automation uh at large

**[02:44]** shift towards automation uh at large across different functions in the

**[02:45]** across different functions in the

**[02:45]** across different functions in the organization. But when you dig into the

**[02:47]** organization. But when you dig into the

**[02:47]** organization. But when you dig into the numbers, there has been actually pretty

**[02:49]** numbers, there has been actually pretty

**[02:49]** numbers, there has been actually pretty significant uh shifts in the patterns of

**[02:52]** significant uh shifts in the patterns of

**[02:52]** significant uh shifts in the patterns of of agent adoption. So this is from

**[02:54]** of agent adoption. So this is from

**[02:54]** of agent adoption. So this is from KPMG's quarterly pulse survey. And it's

**[02:56]** KPMG's quarterly pulse survey. And it's

**[02:56]** KPMG's quarterly pulse survey. And it's a measure of how many enterprises that

**[02:59]** a measure of how many enterprises that

**[02:59]** a measure of how many enterprises that are a part of their survey, which is all


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** are a part of their survey, which is all

**[03:00]** are a part of their survey, which is all companies over a billion dollars in

**[03:01]** companies over a billion dollars in

**[03:01]** companies over a billion dollars in revenue, have uh actual sort of full

**[03:04]** revenue, have uh actual sort of full

**[03:04]** revenue, have uh actual sort of full production agents in deployment. This

**[03:06]** production agents in deployment. This

**[03:06]** production agents in deployment. This isn't pilots, this isn't experiments.

**[03:07]** isn't pilots, this isn't experiments.

**[03:08]** isn't pilots, this isn't experiments. This is where they consider uh some

**[03:09]** This is where they consider uh some

**[03:09]** This is where they consider uh some agent that's actually doing doing kind

**[03:11]** agent that's actually doing doing kind

**[03:11]** agent that's actually doing doing kind of work in a in a full way. And it's

**[03:13]** of work in a in a full way. And it's

**[03:13]** of work in a in a full way. And it's jumped from 11% in Q1 of this year to

**[03:15]** jumped from 11% in Q1 of this year to

**[03:15]** jumped from 11% in Q1 of this year to 42% in their most recent study for Q3.

**[03:18]** 42% in their most recent study for Q3.

**[03:18]** 42% in their most recent study for Q3. So, you actually are seeing pretty

**[03:19]** So, you actually are seeing pretty

**[03:19]** So, you actually are seeing pretty meaningful uptake of of agents inside

**[03:22]** meaningful uptake of of agents inside

**[03:22]** meaningful uptake of of agents inside the enterprise. In fact, I would argue

**[03:24]** the enterprise. In fact, I would argue

**[03:24]** the enterprise. In fact, I would argue based on our conversations that people

**[03:27]** based on our conversations that people

**[03:27]** based on our conversations that people have that it's moved more quickly

**[03:29]** have that it's moved more quickly

**[03:29]** have that it's moved more quickly through the pilot or experimental phase

**[03:32]** through the pilot or experimental phase

**[03:32]** through the pilot or experimental phase than people might have thought. um so

**[03:34]** than people might have thought. um so

**[03:34]** than people might have thought. um so much so that you're actually seeing now

**[03:35]** much so that you're actually seeing now

**[03:35]** much so that you're actually seeing now a big shift in the emphasis around kind

**[03:39]** a big shift in the emphasis around kind

**[03:39]** a big shift in the emphasis around kind of the human side of agents and how

**[03:40]** of the human side of agents and how

**[03:40]** of the human side of agents and how humans are going to interact with agents

**[03:42]** humans are going to interact with agents

**[03:42]** humans are going to interact with agents and it's involving a shift in upskilling

**[03:44]** and it's involving a shift in upskilling

**[03:44]** and it's involving a shift in upskilling and and uh in enablement work. Um you're

**[03:46]** and and uh in enablement work. Um you're

**[03:46]** and and uh in enablement work. Um you're seeing a decrease in the sort of

**[03:49]** seeing a decrease in the sort of

**[03:49]** seeing a decrease in the sort of resistance to agents as people start to

**[03:50]** resistance to agents as people start to

**[03:50]** resistance to agents as people start to actually dig in with them. You're seeing

**[03:52]** actually dig in with them. You're seeing

**[03:52]** actually dig in with them. You're seeing more experiments like these sandboxes

**[03:54]** more experiments like these sandboxes

**[03:54]** more experiments like these sandboxes where people can interact with agents.

**[03:56]** where people can interact with agents.

**[03:56]** where people can interact with agents. So this is a big theme even if it wasn't

**[03:58]** So this is a big theme even if it wasn't

**[03:58]** So this is a big theme even if it wasn't necessarily the dominant theme that some

**[03:59]** necessarily the dominant theme that some

**[03:59]** necessarily the dominant theme that some thought it might be coming into this


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** thought it might be coming into this

**[04:01]** thought it might be coming into this year. [snorts] At the same time, it is

**[04:04]** year. [snorts] At the same time, it is

**[04:04]** year. [snorts] At the same time, it is absolutely the case that many many if

**[04:06]** absolutely the case that many many if

**[04:06]** absolutely the case that many many if not most enterprises are broadly

**[04:08]** not most enterprises are broadly

**[04:08]** not most enterprises are broadly speaking stuck inside sort of pilot and

**[04:11]** speaking stuck inside sort of pilot and

**[04:11]** speaking stuck inside sort of pilot and experimental phases. There is a lot of

**[04:13]** experimental phases. There is a lot of

**[04:14]** experimental phases. There is a lot of challenge around moving from some of

**[04:16]** challenge around moving from some of

**[04:16]** challenge around moving from some of those first exciting experiments to

**[04:17]** those first exciting experiments to

**[04:17]** those first exciting experiments to something that's more scaled. Um, so

**[04:19]** something that's more scaled. Um, so

**[04:19]** something that's more scaled. Um, so this [snorts] is from McKenzie state of

**[04:20]** this [snorts] is from McKenzie state of

**[04:20]** this [snorts] is from McKenzie state of AI study which came out I think a couple

**[04:22]** AI study which came out I think a couple

**[04:22]** AI study which came out I think a couple weeks ago now and you can see only 7% of

**[04:24]** weeks ago now and you can see only 7% of

**[04:24]** weeks ago now and you can see only 7% of the organizations that they talk to

**[04:26]** the organizations that they talk to

**[04:26]** the organizations that they talk to claim or sort of see themselves as as

**[04:28]** claim or sort of see themselves as as

**[04:28]** claim or sort of see themselves as as fully at scale with with AI and agents.

**[04:30]** fully at scale with with AI and agents.

**[04:30]** fully at scale with with AI and agents. and it's something like 62% are either

**[04:32]** and it's something like 62% are either

**[04:32]** and it's something like 62% are either still experimenting or piloting.

**[04:35]** still experimenting or piloting.

**[04:35]** still experimenting or piloting. Interestingly, big organizations are on

**[04:38]** Interestingly, big organizations are on

**[04:38]** Interestingly, big organizations are on in general a little bit ahead in terms

**[04:41]** in general a little bit ahead in terms

**[04:41]** in general a little bit ahead in terms of uh the organizations that are scaling

**[04:43]** of uh the organizations that are scaling

**[04:43]** of uh the organizations that are scaling as compared to small organizations. This

**[04:45]** as compared to small organizations. This

**[04:45]** as compared to small organizations. This has been a a thing that we've noticed

**[04:47]** has been a a thing that we've noticed

**[04:47]** has been a a thing that we've noticed kind of throughout the trajectory of uh

**[04:49]** kind of throughout the trajectory of uh

**[04:49]** kind of throughout the trajectory of uh of AI um adoption over the last couple

**[04:52]** of AI um adoption over the last couple

**[04:52]** of AI um adoption over the last couple of years that you would think that

**[04:53]** of years that you would think that

**[04:53]** of years that you would think that perhaps smaller, more nimble companies

**[04:55]** perhaps smaller, more nimble companies

**[04:55]** perhaps smaller, more nimble companies uh would be more kind of quick to adopt

**[04:58]** uh would be more kind of quick to adopt

**[04:58]** uh would be more kind of quick to adopt these things, but in fact, it's often

**[04:59]** these things, but in fact, it's often


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** these things, but in fact, it's often been the opposite with the biggest

**[05:01]** been the opposite with the biggest

**[05:01]** been the opposite with the biggest organizations making the biggest

**[05:02]** organizations making the biggest

**[05:02]** organizations making the biggest efforts. You can also see from the chart

**[05:04]** efforts. You can also see from the chart

**[05:04]** efforts. You can also see from the chart on the bottom that there's very sort of

**[05:07]** on the bottom that there's very sort of

**[05:07]** on the bottom that there's very sort of jagged patterns of adoption, right?

**[05:08]** jagged patterns of adoption, right?

**[05:08]** jagged patterns of adoption, right? You're starting to see uh from you know

**[05:10]** You're starting to see uh from you know

**[05:10]** You're starting to see uh from you know last year if you looked there's very

**[05:12]** last year if you looked there's very

**[05:12]** last year if you looked there's very similar kind of rates of experimentation

**[05:14]** similar kind of rates of experimentation

**[05:14]** similar kind of rates of experimentation across lots of different departments.

**[05:15]** across lots of different departments.

**[05:15]** across lots of different departments. You're starting to see some pretty big

**[05:17]** You're starting to see some pretty big

**[05:17]** You're starting to see some pretty big breakouts now uh with for example you

**[05:19]** breakouts now uh with for example you

**[05:19]** breakouts now uh with for example you know IT operations kind of jumping out

**[05:21]** know IT operations kind of jumping out

**[05:21]** know IT operations kind of jumping out ahead of other functions.

**[05:23]** ahead of other functions.

**[05:24]** ahead of other functions. I won't spend too much time on this sort

**[05:25]** I won't spend too much time on this sort

**[05:25]** I won't spend too much time on this sort of high performer piece, but I think the

**[05:27]** of high performer piece, but I think the

**[05:27]** of high performer piece, but I think the thing to note because it comes back in

**[05:28]** thing to note because it comes back in

**[05:28]** thing to note because it comes back in and in and some of the stuff that we

**[05:29]** and in and some of the stuff that we

**[05:30]** and in and some of the stuff that we found with our ROI study is that you are

**[05:32]** found with our ROI study is that you are

**[05:32]** found with our ROI study is that you are also starting to see a pretty

**[05:34]** also starting to see a pretty

**[05:34]** also starting to see a pretty significant bifurcation between leaders

**[05:36]** significant bifurcation between leaders

**[05:36]** significant bifurcation between leaders and laggers when it comes to AI

**[05:38]** and laggers when it comes to AI

**[05:38]** and laggers when it comes to AI adoption. And one of the things that

**[05:40]** adoption. And one of the things that

**[05:40]** adoption. And one of the things that tends to distinguish the companies that

**[05:42]** tends to distinguish the companies that

**[05:42]** tends to distinguish the companies that are leading is that they are just doing

**[05:44]** are leading is that they are just doing

**[05:44]** are leading is that they are just doing more of it and they are thinking more

**[05:46]** more of it and they are thinking more

**[05:46]** more of it and they are thinking more comprehensively and systematically about

**[05:48]** comprehensively and systematically about

**[05:48]** comprehensively and systematically about AI and agent adoption. So they are not

**[05:50]** AI and agent adoption. So they are not

**[05:50]** AI and agent adoption. So they are not just sort of doing spot experiments.

**[05:52]** just sort of doing spot experiments.

**[05:52]** just sort of doing spot experiments. They're thinking about their strategy as

**[05:54]** They're thinking about their strategy as

**[05:54]** They're thinking about their strategy as a whole. They're doing multiple things

**[05:55]** a whole. They're doing multiple things

**[05:55]** a whole. They're doing multiple things at once. And importantly, they're not

**[05:57]** at once. And importantly, they're not

**[05:57]** at once. And importantly, they're not just thinking about sort of the very

**[05:59]** just thinking about sort of the very

**[05:59]** just thinking about sort of the very kind of first tier time savings or


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** kind of first tier time savings or

**[06:01]** kind of first tier time savings or productivity types of use cases, they're

**[06:03]** productivity types of use cases, they're

**[06:03]** productivity types of use cases, they're also thinking about how do we grow

**[06:04]** also thinking about how do we grow

**[06:04]** also thinking about how do we grow revenue, how do we create new

**[06:06]** revenue, how do we create new

**[06:06]** revenue, how do we create new capabilities, how do we create new

**[06:07]** capabilities, how do we create new

**[06:07]** capabilities, how do we create new product lines.

**[06:10]** product lines.

**[06:10]** product lines. Overall, it's very clear that despite

**[06:13]** Overall, it's very clear that despite

**[06:13]** Overall, it's very clear that despite what is sort of, you know, the the the

**[06:15]** what is sort of, you know, the the the

**[06:15]** what is sort of, you know, the the the concerns in the media that spend is

**[06:17]** concerns in the media that spend is

**[06:17]** concerns in the media that spend is going to do nothing but increase on

**[06:18]** going to do nothing but increase on

**[06:18]** going to do nothing but increase on this. Um, to the bottom is the KPMG

**[06:20]** this. Um, to the bottom is the KPMG

**[06:20]** this. Um, to the bottom is the KPMG pulse survey again. And this is a an

**[06:23]** pulse survey again. And this is a an

**[06:23]** pulse survey again. And this is a an estimation of the amount of money that

**[06:25]** estimation of the amount of money that

**[06:25]** estimation of the amount of money that these organizations intend to spend on

**[06:26]** these organizations intend to spend on

**[06:26]** these organizations intend to spend on AI over the next 12 months. The

**[06:28]** AI over the next 12 months. The

**[06:28]** AI over the next 12 months. The beginning of the year was 114, which by

**[06:30]** beginning of the year was 114, which by

**[06:30]** beginning of the year was 114, which by the way was up from like 88 in Q4 of

**[06:32]** the way was up from like 88 in Q4 of

**[06:32]** the way was up from like 88 in Q4 of last year. It's now up to in their last

**[06:34]** last year. It's now up to in their last

**[06:34]** last year. It's now up to in their last study 130 million is what they expect to

**[06:36]** study 130 million is what they expect to

**[06:36]** study 130 million is what they expect to spend uh in the in the year ahead, which

**[06:38]** spend uh in the in the year ahead, which

**[06:38]** spend uh in the in the year ahead, which obviously the the total magnitude

**[06:39]** obviously the the total magnitude

**[06:40]** obviously the the total magnitude doesn't matter as much as the change. Um

**[06:41]** doesn't matter as much as the change. Um

**[06:41]** doesn't matter as much as the change. Um you also see the green charts are from

**[06:43]** you also see the green charts are from

**[06:43]** you also see the green charts are from Deote and you can see 90% plus of

**[06:46]** Deote and you can see 90% plus of

**[06:46]** Deote and you can see 90% plus of organizations intend to increase their

**[06:48]** organizations intend to increase their

**[06:48]** organizations intend to increase their spend uh on AI in the next 12 months and

**[06:51]** spend uh on AI in the next 12 months and

**[06:51]** spend uh on AI in the next 12 months and as part of that I think that you're

**[06:53]** as part of that I think that you're

**[06:53]** as part of that I think that you're going to see a much more determined

**[06:55]** going to see a much more determined

**[06:55]** going to see a much more determined conversation around impact and ROI uh

**[06:58]** conversation around impact and ROI uh

**[06:58]** conversation around impact and ROI uh which is a particularly thorny topic but


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** which is a particularly thorny topic but

**[07:01]** which is a particularly thorny topic but interestingly

**[07:02]** interestingly

**[07:02]** interestingly there has been an increase in optimism

**[07:05]** there has been an increase in optimism

**[07:05]** there has been an increase in optimism over the course of this year around the

**[07:07]** over the course of this year around the

**[07:07]** over the course of this year around the realization of AI. So this is from a

**[07:10]** realization of AI. So this is from a

**[07:10]** realization of AI. So this is from a different KPMG study, their annual CEO

**[07:12]** different KPMG study, their annual CEO

**[07:12]** different KPMG study, their annual CEO survey, which interviews tons and tons

**[07:14]** survey, which interviews tons and tons

**[07:14]** survey, which interviews tons and tons of CEOs. And if you look at the 2024

**[07:17]** of CEOs. And if you look at the 2024

**[07:17]** of CEOs. And if you look at the 2024 numbers, 63% of those pled thought that

**[07:20]** numbers, 63% of those pled thought that

**[07:20]** numbers, 63% of those pled thought that it would take between 3 and 5 years to

**[07:23]** it would take between 3 and 5 years to

**[07:23]** it would take between 3 and 5 years to realize ROI from their AI investments.

**[07:25]** realize ROI from their AI investments.

**[07:25]** realize ROI from their AI investments. 20% said 1 to three and 16% said more

**[07:27]** 20% said 1 to three and 16% said more

**[07:27]** 20% said 1 to three and 16% said more than five. This year in that same

**[07:30]** than five. This year in that same

**[07:30]** than five. This year in that same survey, the number that said 1 to 3

**[07:32]** survey, the number that said 1 to 3

**[07:32]** survey, the number that said 1 to 3 years had gone up to 67%. There were now

**[07:35]** years had gone up to 67%. There were now

**[07:35]** years had gone up to 67%. There were now 19% who said 6 months to 1 year. uh and

**[07:38]** 19% who said 6 months to 1 year. uh and

**[07:38]** 19% who said 6 months to 1 year. uh and 3 to 5 years was down to just 12%. So

**[07:41]** 3 to 5 years was down to just 12%. So

**[07:41]** 3 to 5 years was down to just 12%. So huge huge kind of pull forward of

**[07:43]** huge huge kind of pull forward of

**[07:43]** huge huge kind of pull forward of expectations of of ROI realization. The

**[07:47]** expectations of of ROI realization. The

**[07:47]** expectations of of ROI realization. The challenge is that ROI is really tough.

**[07:49]** challenge is that ROI is really tough.

**[07:49]** challenge is that ROI is really tough. So this is back to the poll survey. 78%

**[07:52]** So this is back to the poll survey. 78%

**[07:52]** So this is back to the poll survey. 78% of those pled in that in that survey

**[07:55]** of those pled in that in that survey

**[07:55]** of those pled in that in that survey said that they thought that ROI is going

**[07:57]** said that they thought that ROI is going

**[07:57]** said that they thought that ROI is going to basically become a bigger

**[07:58]** to basically become a bigger

**[07:58]** to basically become a bigger consideration in the year to come. Uh


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** consideration in the year to come. Uh

**[08:00]** consideration in the year to come. Uh but also 78% said that traditional

**[08:03]** but also 78% said that traditional

**[08:03]** but also 78% said that traditional impact metrics and measures were having

**[08:05]** impact metrics and measures were having

**[08:05]** impact metrics and measures were having a very hard time keeping up with the

**[08:07]** a very hard time keeping up with the

**[08:07]** a very hard time keeping up with the with the new reality that we were living

**[08:09]** with the new reality that we were living

**[08:09]** with the new reality that we were living in. And this is something that I've

**[08:10]** in. And this is something that I've

**[08:10]** in. And this is something that I've heard constantly over and over from CIOS

**[08:12]** heard constantly over and over from CIOS

**[08:12]** heard constantly over and over from CIOS and other people who are in charge of

**[08:13]** and other people who are in charge of

**[08:13]** and other people who are in charge of these investments that the the the ways

**[08:15]** these investments that the the the ways

**[08:16]** these investments that the the the ways that we have measured impact of previous

**[08:17]** that we have measured impact of previous

**[08:17]** that we have measured impact of previous technologies and just previous

**[08:18]** technologies and just previous

**[08:18]** technologies and just previous initiatives are kind of falling flat

**[08:21]** initiatives are kind of falling flat

**[08:21]** initiatives are kind of falling flat with AI. And so that got us thinking

**[08:23]** with AI. And so that got us thinking

**[08:23]** with AI. And so that got us thinking about the the the overall need that we

**[08:25]** about the the the overall need that we

**[08:26]** about the the the overall need that we have to just have more information. I'm

**[08:29]** have to just have more information. I'm

**[08:29]** have to just have more information. I'm not even talking about good systematic

**[08:31]** not even talking about good systematic

**[08:31]** not even talking about good systematic information, just more information

**[08:33]** information, just more information

**[08:33]** information, just more information around what ROI looks like, what impact

**[08:36]** around what ROI looks like, what impact

**[08:36]** around what ROI looks like, what impact looks like, and you know, I've got this

**[08:37]** looks like, and you know, I've got this

**[08:38]** looks like, and you know, I've got this great podcast audience. They're super

**[08:39]** great podcast audience. They're super

**[08:39]** great podcast audience. They're super engaged. And so, we just decided, screw

**[08:41]** engaged. And so, we just decided, screw

**[08:41]** engaged. And so, we just decided, screw it. We're going to ask them, we're just

**[08:42]** it. We're going to ask them, we're just

**[08:42]** it. We're going to ask them, we're just going to ask them to report on what ROI

**[08:45]** going to ask them to report on what ROI

**[08:45]** going to ask them to report on what ROI they're finding from their use cases.

**[08:47]** they're finding from their use cases.

**[08:47]** they're finding from their use cases. So, this went up at the very end of

**[08:48]** So, this went up at the very end of

**[08:48]** So, this went up at the very end of October. Uh like I said as of this

**[08:50]** October. Uh like I said as of this

**[08:50]** October. Uh like I said as of this morning or when I looked last looked

**[08:51]** morning or when I looked last looked

**[08:52]** morning or when I looked last looked we've had over a thousand submissions uh

**[08:54]** we've had over a thousand submissions uh

**[08:54]** we've had over a thousand submissions uh a thousand individual organizations

**[08:55]** a thousand individual organizations

**[08:55]** a thousand individual organizations rather submit something like 3500 use

**[08:57]** rather submit something like 3500 use

**[08:57]** rather submit something like 3500 use cases and um this is uh some some of the


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** cases and um this is uh some some of the

**[09:00]** cases and um this is uh some some of the first observations that we had around um

**[09:03]** first observations that we had around um

**[09:03]** first observations that we had around um kind of the first 2500.

**[09:05]** kind of the first 2500.

**[09:05]** kind of the first 2500. So the impact categories the way that we

**[09:07]** So the impact categories the way that we

**[09:07]** So the impact categories the way that we divided things was into sort of eight

**[09:09]** divided things was into sort of eight

**[09:09]** divided things was into sort of eight broad categories of impact um which will

**[09:12]** broad categories of impact um which will

**[09:12]** broad categories of impact um which will all I think be very intuitive to you

**[09:13]** all I think be very intuitive to you

**[09:13]** all I think be very intuitive to you guys. time savings, increased output,

**[09:16]** guys. time savings, increased output,

**[09:16]** guys. time savings, increased output, improvement in quality, new

**[09:17]** improvement in quality, new

**[09:17]** improvement in quality, new capabilities, improved decision- making,

**[09:20]** capabilities, improved decision- making,

**[09:20]** capabilities, improved decision- making, cost savings, increased revenue, and

**[09:22]** cost savings, increased revenue, and

**[09:22]** cost savings, increased revenue, and risk reduction. So, basically, it was

**[09:24]** risk reduction. So, basically, it was

**[09:24]** risk reduction. So, basically, it was trying to think of like kind of a a

**[09:25]** trying to think of like kind of a a

**[09:25]** trying to think of like kind of a a broad simple heristic for uh for for

**[09:27]** broad simple heristic for uh for for

**[09:27]** broad simple heristic for uh for for kind of dividing or subdividing the

**[09:29]** kind of dividing or subdividing the

**[09:29]** kind of dividing or subdividing the different the different ways that people

**[09:30]** different the different ways that people

**[09:30]** different the different ways that people are thinking about ROI. And TLDDR is

**[09:34]** are thinking about ROI. And TLDDR is

**[09:34]** are thinking about ROI. And TLDDR is that people are finding uh ROI right

**[09:37]** that people are finding uh ROI right

**[09:37]** that people are finding uh ROI right now. Um, now again, the caveats are that

**[09:40]** now. Um, now again, the caveats are that

**[09:40]** now. Um, now again, the caveats are that this is a highly infranchised audience.

**[09:41]** this is a highly infranchised audience.

**[09:41]** this is a highly infranchised audience. they're listening to a daily AI podcast

**[09:43]** they're listening to a daily AI podcast

**[09:43]** they're listening to a daily AI podcast and they are voluntarily sharing this.

**[09:45]** and they are voluntarily sharing this.

**[09:45]** and they are voluntarily sharing this. So, I think that, you know, there's

**[09:46]** So, I think that, you know, there's

**[09:46]** So, I think that, you know, there's there's some caveing there, but you have

**[09:48]** there's some caveing there, but you have

**[09:48]** there's some caveing there, but you have 44.3% saying that they're seeing modest

**[09:51]** 44.3% saying that they're seeing modest

**[09:51]** 44.3% saying that they're seeing modest ROI right now. And then you have another

**[09:53]** ROI right now. And then you have another

**[09:53]** ROI right now. And then you have another 37.6% seeing high ROI. For the purposes

**[09:56]** 37.6% seeing high ROI. For the purposes

**[09:56]** 37.6% seeing high ROI. For the purposes of a lot of these stats, high ROI will

**[09:58]** of a lot of these stats, high ROI will

**[09:58]** of a lot of these stats, high ROI will be significant plus transformational. Uh


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:01]** be significant plus transformational. Uh

**[10:01]** be significant plus transformational. Uh only 5% or so are seeing negative ROI.

**[10:04]** only 5% or so are seeing negative ROI.

**[10:04]** only 5% or so are seeing negative ROI. And keep in mind, negative ROI doesn't

**[10:05]** And keep in mind, negative ROI doesn't

**[10:05]** And keep in mind, negative ROI doesn't mean that they think programs are

**[10:06]** mean that they think programs are

**[10:06]** mean that they think programs are failing. It just means they haven't

**[10:08]** failing. It just means they haven't

**[10:08]** failing. It just means they haven't they've spent more than they've gained

**[10:10]** they've spent more than they've gained

**[10:10]** they've spent more than they've gained uh in terms of how their their

**[10:11]** uh in terms of how their their

**[10:11]** uh in terms of how their their perception is. More than that,

**[10:13]** perception is. More than that,

**[10:13]** perception is. More than that, expectations are absolutely skyhigh. 67%

**[10:18]** expectations are absolutely skyhigh. 67%

**[10:18]** expectations are absolutely skyhigh. 67% think over the next year they will see

**[10:20]** think over the next year they will see

**[10:20]** think over the next year they will see uh increased and high growth in their

**[10:22]** uh increased and high growth in their

**[10:22]** uh increased and high growth in their ROI. [snorts] So we have a really

**[10:24]** ROI. [snorts] So we have a really

**[10:24]** ROI. [snorts] So we have a really optimistic sense from the ground view of

**[10:27]** optimistic sense from the ground view of

**[10:27]** optimistic sense from the ground view of where ROI is going to be in AI. Um you

**[10:30]** where ROI is going to be in AI. Um you

**[10:30]** where ROI is going to be in AI. Um you even have the teams that are currently

**[10:31]** even have the teams that are currently

**[10:32]** even have the teams that are currently experiencing negative ROI. 53% say that

**[10:35]** experiencing negative ROI. 53% say that

**[10:35]** experiencing negative ROI. 53% say that they're going to see high growth. So

**[10:36]** they're going to see high growth. So

**[10:36]** they're going to see high growth. So very very optimistic. Um as [snorts] you

**[10:39]** very very optimistic. Um as [snorts] you

**[10:39]** very very optimistic. Um as [snorts] you might imagine, time savings is the

**[10:42]** might imagine, time savings is the

**[10:42]** might imagine, time savings is the default. It's the starting point for so

**[10:44]** default. It's the starting point for so

**[10:44]** default. It's the starting point for so many organizations. It represents about

**[10:45]** many organizations. It represents about

**[10:45]** many organizations. It represents about 35% of the use cases. After that,

**[10:48]** 35% of the use cases. After that,

**[10:48]** 35% of the use cases. After that, increasing output, quality improvement,

**[10:49]** increasing output, quality improvement,

**[10:49]** increasing output, quality improvement, basically all those things that you

**[10:50]** basically all those things that you

**[10:50]** basically all those things that you would imagine around productivity are

**[10:52]** would imagine around productivity are

**[10:52]** would imagine around productivity are sort of like the dominant categories

**[10:54]** sort of like the dominant categories

**[10:54]** sort of like the dominant categories when it comes to these uh when it comes

**[10:56]** when it comes to these uh when it comes

**[10:56]** when it comes to these uh when it comes to these use cases. When it comes to the

**[10:58]** to these use cases. When it comes to the

**[10:58]** to these use cases. When it comes to the specifics around time savings, you see a


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** specifics around time savings, you see a

**[11:00]** specifics around time savings, you see a real cluster between 1 and 10 hours,

**[11:02]** real cluster between 1 and 10 hours,

**[11:02]** real cluster between 1 and 10 hours, especially right around 5 hours. And I

**[11:04]** especially right around 5 hours. And I

**[11:04]** especially right around 5 hours. And I think this is interesting to call out

**[11:05]** think this is interesting to call out

**[11:05]** think this is interesting to call out because it's so obvious to all of us who

**[11:08]** because it's so obvious to all of us who

**[11:08]** because it's so obvious to all of us who are inside building these things uh

**[11:10]** are inside building these things uh

**[11:10]** are inside building these things uh whether you are a developer or an

**[11:12]** whether you are a developer or an

**[11:12]** whether you are a developer or an entrepreneur or just someone sort of in

**[11:13]** entrepreneur or just someone sort of in

**[11:13]** entrepreneur or just someone sort of in and around it how the the vast breadth

**[11:17]** and around it how the the vast breadth

**[11:17]** and around it how the the vast breadth of opportunity that AI represents new

**[11:19]** of opportunity that AI represents new

**[11:19]** of opportunity that AI represents new capabilities things unimagined yet. It's

**[11:21]** capabilities things unimagined yet. It's

**[11:21]** capabilities things unimagined yet. It's hard to or it's easy to forget that if

**[11:23]** hard to or it's easy to forget that if

**[11:23]** hard to or it's easy to forget that if you save 5 hours a week or 10 hours a

**[11:25]** you save 5 hours a week or 10 hours a

**[11:25]** you save 5 hours a week or 10 hours a week you're talking about winning back 7

**[11:27]** week you're talking about winning back 7

**[11:27]** week you're talking about winning back 7 to 10 work weeks a year. Uh and that's

**[11:30]** to 10 work weeks a year. Uh and that's

**[11:30]** to 10 work weeks a year. Uh and that's very very powerful. And when it comes to

**[11:32]** very very powerful. And when it comes to

**[11:32]** very very powerful. And when it comes to a lot of these enterprises, that is a

**[11:34]** a lot of these enterprises, that is a

**[11:34]** a lot of these enterprises, that is a very meaningful thing, even if it's not

**[11:36]** very meaningful thing, even if it's not

**[11:36]** very meaningful thing, even if it's not what they're ultimately in it for.

**[11:39]** what they're ultimately in it for.

**[11:39]** what they're ultimately in it for. Interestingly though, it's very clear

**[11:40]** Interestingly though, it's very clear

**[11:40]** Interestingly though, it's very clear that the story, although it might be uh

**[11:42]** that the story, although it might be uh

**[11:42]** that the story, although it might be uh have a concentration in time savings, is

**[11:44]** have a concentration in time savings, is

**[11:44]** have a concentration in time savings, is about much more than time savings. So

**[11:46]** about much more than time savings. So

**[11:46]** about much more than time savings. So this is the ROI distribution category uh

**[11:49]** this is the ROI distribution category uh

**[11:49]** this is the ROI distribution category uh ROI distribution by organization size.

**[11:52]** ROI distribution by organization size.

**[11:52]** ROI distribution by organization size. And this starts to get really

**[11:53]** And this starts to get really

**[11:53]** And this starts to get really interesting where you can see that there

**[11:55]** interesting where you can see that there

**[11:55]** interesting where you can see that there are some differences in where different

**[11:58]** are some differences in where different

**[11:58]** are some differences in where different size organizations are focused. So for


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** size organizations are focused. So for

**[12:00]** size organizations are focused. So for example, the organization size between

**[12:02]** example, the organization size between

**[12:02]** example, the organization size between 200 and a,000 people has a higher

**[12:05]** 200 and a,000 people has a higher

**[12:05]** 200 and a,000 people has a higher portion of their use cases concentrated

**[12:07]** portion of their use cases concentrated

**[12:07]** portion of their use cases concentrated in increasing output. Now we haven't

**[12:10]** in increasing output. Now we haven't

**[12:10]** in increasing output. Now we haven't taken the time yet to really figure out

**[12:11]** taken the time yet to really figure out

**[12:11]** taken the time yet to really figure out exactly what this means or even

**[12:12]** exactly what this means or even

**[12:12]** exactly what this means or even speculate on on what this means. But I

**[12:15]** speculate on on what this means. But I

**[12:15]** speculate on on what this means. But I think it's interesting that this is a

**[12:16]** think it's interesting that this is a

**[12:16]** think it's interesting that this is a category of organization that has often

**[12:19]** category of organization that has often

**[12:19]** category of organization that has often reached a certain scale but is still

**[12:20]** reached a certain scale but is still

**[12:20]** reached a certain scale but is still very much striving for more and so seems

**[12:22]** very much striving for more and so seems

**[12:22]** very much striving for more and so seems to be focused more on use cases that

**[12:24]** to be focused more on use cases that

**[12:24]** to be focused more on use cases that expand their capabilities.

**[12:27]** expand their capabilities.

**[12:27]** expand their capabilities. Same thing with uh when you start to

**[12:29]** Same thing with uh when you start to

**[12:29]** Same thing with uh when you start to divide things by role you see real kind

**[12:32]** divide things by role you see real kind

**[12:32]** divide things by role you see real kind of variance where for example seuitees

**[12:34]** of variance where for example seuitees

**[12:34]** of variance where for example seuitees and leaders uh are less focused on those

**[12:36]** and leaders uh are less focused on those

**[12:36]** and leaders uh are less focused on those time savings use cases and more focused

**[12:45]** and uh and new capabilities in general we're finding that sea

**[12:47]** in general we're finding that sea

**[12:47]** in general we're finding that sea leaders uh and just sort of seuite and

**[12:49]** leaders uh and just sort of seuite and

**[12:49]** leaders uh and just sort of seuite and and leaders in general are even more

**[12:56]** transformational impact than people who are in more junior positions. Now, some

**[12:58]** are in more junior positions. Now, some

**[12:58]** are in more junior positions. Now, some of this might be sort of selection bias


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** of this might be sort of selection bias

**[13:00]** of this might be sort of selection bias in terms of um what types of use cases

**[13:03]** in terms of um what types of use cases

**[13:03]** in terms of um what types of use cases you are focused on. If you are in that

**[13:04]** you are focused on. If you are in that

**[13:04]** you are focused on. If you are in that seuite, you're thinking about things

**[13:06]** seuite, you're thinking about things

**[13:06]** seuite, you're thinking about things that inherently if they work are more

**[13:07]** that inherently if they work are more

**[13:07]** that inherently if they work are more transformational. Uh but it is notable

**[13:09]** transformational. Uh but it is notable

**[13:09]** transformational. Uh but it is notable that 17% of uh of the use cases that

**[13:13]** that 17% of uh of the use cases that

**[13:13]** that 17% of uh of the use cases that that people in those leadership

**[13:14]** that people in those leadership

**[13:14]** that people in those leadership positions have submitted uh they say

**[13:15]** positions have submitted uh they say

**[13:15]** positions have submitted uh they say have transformational impact and ROI

**[13:17]** have transformational impact and ROI

**[13:17]** have transformational impact and ROI already.

**[13:19]** already.

**[13:19]** already. [snorts] Uh I'm going to skip this

**[13:20]** [snorts] Uh I'm going to skip this

**[13:20]** [snorts] Uh I'm going to skip this because there's we don't have time for

**[13:21]** because there's we don't have time for

**[13:21]** because there's we don't have time for too much. um you're seeing interestingly

**[13:25]** too much. um you're seeing interestingly

**[13:25]** too much. um you're seeing interestingly uh a concentration um where the smallest

**[13:28]** uh a concentration um where the smallest

**[13:28]** uh a concentration um where the smallest organizations are getting more of that

**[13:30]** organizations are getting more of that

**[13:30]** organizations are getting more of that transformational benefit early. Um one

**[13:33]** transformational benefit early. Um one

**[13:33]** transformational benefit early. Um one of the things that I want to do

**[13:34]** of the things that I want to do

**[13:34]** of the things that I want to do following this study is maybe do a sort

**[13:36]** following this study is maybe do a sort

**[13:36]** following this study is maybe do a sort of second round where we dig into what

**[13:39]** of second round where we dig into what

**[13:39]** of second round where we dig into what this 1 to 50 person uh size really looks

**[13:43]** this 1 to 50 person uh size really looks

**[13:43]** this 1 to 50 person uh size really looks like. I actually think that whereas

**[13:45]** like. I actually think that whereas

**[13:45]** like. I actually think that whereas there might be a lot of similarity

**[13:47]** there might be a lot of similarity

**[13:47]** there might be a lot of similarity between a 1000 and a 2,000 person

**[13:49]** between a 1000 and a 2,000 person

**[13:49]** between a 1000 and a 2,000 person organization, there could be a wild

**[13:51]** organization, there could be a wild

**[13:51]** organization, there could be a wild difference between a threeperson, you

**[13:53]** difference between a threeperson, you

**[13:53]** difference between a threeperson, you know, small company and a 40 person

**[13:55]** know, small company and a 40 person

**[13:55]** know, small company and a 40 person company. And so I'd really like to dig

**[13:57]** company. And so I'd really like to dig

**[13:57]** company. And so I'd really like to dig into that more. But you are definitely

**[13:58]** into that more. But you are definitely

**[13:58]** into that more. But you are definitely seeing a a lot of impact in those sort


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:02]** seeing a a lot of impact in those sort

**[14:02]** seeing a a lot of impact in those sort of more small nimble moving

**[14:04]** of more small nimble moving

**[14:04]** of more small nimble moving organizations.

**[14:05]** organizations.

**[14:05]** organizations. Uh as you might expect, coding and uh

**[14:08]** Uh as you might expect, coding and uh

**[14:08]** Uh as you might expect, coding and uh and software related or uh use cases

**[14:11]** and software related or uh use cases

**[14:11]** and software related or uh use cases have a higher ROI than average and a

**[14:13]** have a higher ROI than average and a

**[14:13]** have a higher ROI than average and a lower negative ROI than average. Um one

**[14:16]** lower negative ROI than average. Um one

**[14:16]** lower negative ROI than average. Um one really interesting kind of you know

**[14:18]** really interesting kind of you know

**[14:18]** really interesting kind of you know pulling on a specific category of use

**[14:20]** pulling on a specific category of use

**[14:20]** pulling on a specific category of use cases. Risk reduction is our lowest

**[14:23]** cases. Risk reduction is our lowest

**[14:23]** cases. Risk reduction is our lowest category in terms of the percentage of

**[14:25]** category in terms of the percentage of

**[14:25]** category in terms of the percentage of use cases that that that was their

**[14:27]** use cases that that that was their

**[14:27]** use cases that that that was their primary benefit. So when you're filling

**[14:28]** primary benefit. So when you're filling

**[14:28]** primary benefit. So when you're filling out the survey, which is by the way at

**[14:29]** out the survey, which is by the way at

**[14:29]** out the survey, which is by the way at roervey.ai AI if you want to check it

**[14:31]** roervey.ai AI if you want to check it

**[14:31]** roervey.ai AI if you want to check it out. Uh you basically only get to pick a

**[14:35]** out. Uh you basically only get to pick a

**[14:35]** out. Uh you basically only get to pick a primary ROI benefit. We didn't want it

**[14:37]** primary ROI benefit. We didn't want it

**[14:37]** primary ROI benefit. We didn't want it to be super sort of um we wanted you to

**[14:39]** to be super sort of um we wanted you to

**[14:39]** to be super sort of um we wanted you to pick and and hone in on the thing that

**[14:41]** pick and and hone in on the thing that

**[14:41]** pick and and hone in on the thing that was uh seemed most important or most

**[14:43]** was uh seemed most important or most

**[14:43]** was uh seemed most important or most significant. And so only 3.4% have risk

**[14:46]** significant. And so only 3.4% have risk

**[14:46]** significant. And so only 3.4% have risk reduction as their primary benefit uh in

**[14:50]** reduction as their primary benefit uh in

**[14:50]** reduction as their primary benefit uh in terms of ROI categories. But it is by

**[14:52]** terms of ROI categories. But it is by

**[14:52]** terms of ROI categories. But it is by far those use cases are by far the most

**[14:55]** far those use cases are by far the most

**[14:55]** far those use cases are by far the most likely to have transformational impact

**[14:59]** likely to have transformational impact

**[14:59]** likely to have transformational impact as as the as as their outcome. It's at


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:01]** as as the as as their outcome. It's at

**[15:01]** as as the as as their outcome. It's at 25%. So a full quarter of those uh have

**[15:04]** 25%. So a full quarter of those uh have

**[15:04]** 25%. So a full quarter of those uh have transformational ROI. And interestingly,

**[15:06]** transformational ROI. And interestingly,

**[15:06]** transformational ROI. And interestingly, I was having this conversation with a

**[15:08]** I was having this conversation with a

**[15:08]** I was having this conversation with a couple of my friends who work in sort of

**[15:09]** couple of my friends who work in sort of

**[17:11]** Now there's lots of reasons for that but

**[17:11]** Now there's lots of reasons for that but I do think it speaks to that that core

**[17:13]** I do think it speaks to that that core

**[17:13]** I do think it speaks to that that core idea that once you move beyond kind of

**[17:21]** lot of opportunity uh to to sort of grow

**[17:21]** lot of opportunity uh to to sort of grow grow the impact of the organization. So,

**[17:23]** grow the impact of the organization. So,
