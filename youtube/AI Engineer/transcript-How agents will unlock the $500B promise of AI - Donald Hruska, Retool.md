**[00:17]** Yes, my name is Donald. I lead the new

**[00:17]** Yes, my name is Donald. I lead the new product teams at Retool. Uh Retool made

**[00:21]** product teams at Retool. Uh Retool made

**[00:21]** product teams at Retool. Uh Retool made its name in the earlier days working on

**[00:23]** its name in the earlier days working on

**[00:23]** its name in the earlier days working on internal tools, making it really easy

**[00:25]** internal tools, making it really easy

**[00:25]** internal tools, making it really easy for any business out there to build

**[00:27]** for any business out there to build

**[00:27]** for any business out there to build internal applications. And we've been

**[00:30]** internal applications. And we've been

**[00:30]** internal applications. And we've been making it easy to connect with AI

**[00:31]** making it easy to connect with AI

**[00:31]** making it easy to connect with AI providers for a couple years now, but

**[00:34]** providers for a couple years now, but

**[00:34]** providers for a couple years now, but we're now breaking into Agentic AI with

**[00:36]** we're now breaking into Agentic AI with

**[00:36]** we're now breaking into Agentic AI with the release of Retool agents, which we

**[00:38]** the release of Retool agents, which we

**[00:38]** the release of Retool agents, which we announced last week and made available

**[00:39]** announced last week and made available

**[00:39]** announced last week and made available to our customers.

**[00:41]** to our customers.

**[00:41]** to our customers. So half a trillion dollars has been

**[00:45]** So half a trillion dollars has been

**[00:45]** So half a trillion dollars has been spent on AI infrastructure and yet most

**[00:48]** spent on AI infrastructure and yet most

**[00:48]** spent on AI infrastructure and yet most large companies are really just still

**[00:50]** large companies are really just still

**[00:50]** large companies are really just still stuck with toy chat bots and messing

**[00:53]** stuck with toy chat bots and messing

**[00:53]** stuck with toy chat bots and messing around with code generation. So, let's

**[00:56]** around with code generation. So, let's

**[00:56]** around with code generation. So, let's talk about why that changes this year

**[00:58]** talk about why that changes this year

**[00:58]** talk about why that changes this year with enterprises finally being able to


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** with enterprises finally being able to

**[01:00]** with enterprises finally being able to build agents with guardrails that plug

**[01:02]** build agents with guardrails that plug

**[01:02]** build agents with guardrails that plug into real production systems.

**[01:09]** Reuters shared last week that Anthropic

**[01:09]** Reuters shared last week that Anthropic hit at the end of May, so a couple days

**[01:11]** hit at the end of May, so a couple days

**[01:11]** hit at the end of May, so a couple days ago, $3 billion in annualized revenue.

**[01:14]** ago, $3 billion in annualized revenue.

**[01:14]** ago, $3 billion in annualized revenue. That's up from $2 billion at the end of

**[01:17]** That's up from $2 billion at the end of

**[01:17]** That's up from $2 billion at the end of March and $1 billion in December. So,

**[01:19]** March and $1 billion in December. So,

**[01:19]** March and $1 billion in December. So, that's 3xing their annualized revenue

**[01:22]** that's 3xing their annualized revenue

**[01:22]** that's 3xing their annualized revenue growth in 5 months, which is some

**[01:24]** growth in 5 months, which is some

**[01:24]** growth in 5 months, which is some staggering growth. That's not to mention

**[01:26]** staggering growth. That's not to mention

**[01:26]** staggering growth. That's not to mention OpenAI is slated to end 2025 at 12

**[01:29]** OpenAI is slated to end 2025 at 12

**[01:29]** OpenAI is slated to end 2025 at 12 billion in revenue, over 3x where they

**[01:31]** billion in revenue, over 3x where they

**[01:31]** billion in revenue, over 3x where they were at at the end of last year.

**[01:33]** were at at the end of last year.

**[01:34]** were at at the end of last year. These growth rates are massive, and this

**[01:35]** These growth rates are massive, and this

**[01:35]** These growth rates are massive, and this largely is fueled by enterprise AI

**[01:37]** largely is fueled by enterprise AI

**[01:37]** largely is fueled by enterprise AI spend.

**[01:39]** spend.

**[01:39]** spend. And coding is growing. Teams love using

**[01:43]** And coding is growing. Teams love using

**[01:43]** And coding is growing. Teams love using Cursor and Windsurf, including my own. I

**[01:46]** Cursor and Windsurf, including my own. I

**[01:46]** Cursor and Windsurf, including my own. I think every engineer on my team is using

**[01:48]** think every engineer on my team is using

**[01:48]** think every engineer on my team is using one of these tools. and engineers are

**[01:50]** one of these tools. and engineers are

**[01:50]** one of these tools. and engineers are now becoming experts in prompting and in

**[01:52]** now becoming experts in prompting and in

**[01:52]** now becoming experts in prompting and in code review and letting LLM do the heavy

**[01:55]** code review and letting LLM do the heavy

**[01:55]** code review and letting LLM do the heavy lifting of a lot of day-to-day coding.

**[01:58]** lifting of a lot of day-to-day coding.

**[01:58]** lifting of a lot of day-to-day coding. Their workflows really are just

**[01:59]** Their workflows really are just

**[01:59]** Their workflows really are just completely transformed right now and


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:01]** completely transformed right now and

**[02:01]** completely transformed right now and their productivity is through the roof.

**[02:04]** their productivity is through the roof.

**[02:04]** their productivity is through the roof. If you look at Open Router, which gives

**[02:07]** If you look at Open Router, which gives

**[02:07]** If you look at Open Router, which gives access to a unified API that exposes

**[02:09]** access to a unified API that exposes

**[02:09]** access to a unified API that exposes hundreds of AI models, their top apps

**[02:13]** hundreds of AI models, their top apps

**[02:13]** hundreds of AI models, their top apps list is really dominated by code

**[02:15]** list is really dominated by code

**[02:15]** list is really dominated by code generation use cases as you can see

**[02:17]** generation use cases as you can see

**[02:17]** generation use cases as you can see here.

**[02:24]** And the LLM providers are taking note.

**[02:24]** And the LLM providers are taking note. SWEBench verified is a benchmark that

**[02:26]** SWEBench verified is a benchmark that

**[02:26]** SWEBench verified is a benchmark that measures an AI model's ability to

**[02:28]** measures an AI model's ability to

**[02:28]** measures an AI model's ability to perform real world coding tasks. If you

**[02:31]** perform real world coding tasks. If you

**[02:31]** perform real world coding tasks. If you look at GPT4.1,

**[02:33]** look at GPT4.1,

**[02:33]** look at GPT4.1, it's up 21 percentage points from

**[02:35]** it's up 21 percentage points from

**[02:35]** it's up 21 percentage points from GPT4.0.

**[02:37]** GPT4.0.

**[02:37]** GPT4.0. Really showing the investment that

**[02:39]** Really showing the investment that

**[02:39]** Really showing the investment that OpenAI is is putting behind making their

**[02:41]** OpenAI is is putting behind making their

**[02:41]** OpenAI is is putting behind making their models work really well for coding use

**[02:43]** models work really well for coding use

**[02:43]** models work really well for coding use cases. And Gemini 2.5 Pro is up another

**[02:47]** cases. And Gemini 2.5 Pro is up another

**[02:47]** cases. And Gemini 2.5 Pro is up another 9 percentage points from GPT41. Devs are

**[02:50]** 9 percentage points from GPT41. Devs are

**[02:50]** 9 percentage points from GPT41. Devs are raving about Gemini 2.5 Pro. I think

**[02:53]** raving about Gemini 2.5 Pro. I think

**[02:53]** raving about Gemini 2.5 Pro. I think nearly every developer I know using

**[02:54]** nearly every developer I know using

**[02:54]** nearly every developer I know using cursor is talking about how well it

**[02:55]** cursor is talking about how well it

**[02:55]** cursor is talking about how well it works.

**[02:57]** works.

**[02:57]** works. And finally, the term vibe coding has


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** And finally, the term vibe coding has

**[03:00]** And finally, the term vibe coding has firmly planted itself in the zeitgeist.

**[03:03]** firmly planted itself in the zeitgeist.

**[03:03]** firmly planted itself in the zeitgeist. Last week on the Andre Horowitz podcast,

**[03:06]** Last week on the Andre Horowitz podcast,

**[03:06]** Last week on the Andre Horowitz podcast, Rick Rubin, the legendary music

**[03:07]** Rick Rubin, the legendary music

**[03:08]** Rick Rubin, the legendary music producer, said vibe coding is the punk

**[03:10]** producer, said vibe coding is the punk

**[03:10]** producer, said vibe coding is the punk rock of software. talking about in the

**[03:13]** rock of software. talking about in the

**[03:13]** rock of software. talking about in the same way that punk rock with its

**[03:14]** same way that punk rock with its

**[03:14]** same way that punk rock with its simplicity made it really easy for

**[03:16]** simplicity made it really easy for

**[03:16]** simplicity made it really easy for anyone who had something to say to go

**[03:18]** anyone who had something to say to go

**[03:18]** anyone who had something to say to go make a song. Vibe coding is doing that

**[03:20]** make a song. Vibe coding is doing that

**[03:20]** make a song. Vibe coding is doing that now for anyone with an idea.

**[03:27]** And vibe coding is so powerful because

**[03:27]** And vibe coding is so powerful because you just tell cursor or wind surf kind

**[03:29]** you just tell cursor or wind surf kind

**[03:30]** you just tell cursor or wind surf kind of the gist of what you want and it goes

**[03:31]** of the gist of what you want and it goes

**[03:31]** of the gist of what you want and it goes and it thinks and it thinks and it acts

**[03:33]** and it thinks and it thinks and it acts

**[03:33]** and it thinks and it thinks and it acts and it writes that code for you. This is

**[03:35]** and it writes that code for you. This is

**[03:35]** and it writes that code for you. This is a lot different than basic text

**[03:37]** a lot different than basic text

**[03:37]** a lot different than basic text completions or copying code from chat

**[03:40]** completions or copying code from chat

**[03:40]** completions or copying code from chat GPT into your code editor. This is

**[03:43]** GPT into your code editor. This is

**[03:43]** GPT into your code editor. This is agentic AI.

**[03:45]** agentic AI.

**[03:46]** agentic AI. So vibe coding needs agents to work. But

**[03:50]** So vibe coding needs agents to work. But

**[03:50]** So vibe coding needs agents to work. But why should we stop with this idea at

**[03:52]** why should we stop with this idea at

**[03:52]** why should we stop with this idea at just code? Code is testable. It has

**[03:56]** just code? Code is testable. It has

**[03:56]** just code? Code is testable. It has semantics. It's easy to validate and

**[03:58]** semantics. It's easy to validate and

**[03:58]** semantics. It's easy to validate and understand if the LLM is generating it


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** understand if the LLM is generating it

**[04:00]** understand if the LLM is generating it correctly. But could we apply the same

**[04:02]** correctly. But could we apply the same

**[04:02]** correctly. But could we apply the same idea to any problem in our business? And

**[04:05]** idea to any problem in our business? And

**[04:05]** idea to any problem in our business? And to do that, we would need general

**[04:07]** to do that, we would need general

**[04:07]** to do that, we would need general purpose agents.

**[04:10]** purpose agents.

**[04:10]** purpose agents. And building the agent, believe it or

**[04:12]** And building the agent, believe it or

**[04:12]** And building the agent, believe it or not, I would say, is actually the easy

**[04:13]** not, I would say, is actually the easy

**[04:13]** not, I would say, is actually the easy part. You could build a really basic

**[04:15]** part. You could build a really basic

**[04:15]** part. You could build a really basic agent in about a 100 lines of JavaScript

**[04:17]** agent in about a 100 lines of JavaScript

**[04:17]** agent in about a 100 lines of JavaScript or Python. Have the start of one right

**[04:19]** or Python. Have the start of one right

**[04:19]** or Python. Have the start of one right here. And what I'm talking about here is

**[04:21]** here. And what I'm talking about here is

**[04:21]** here. And what I'm talking about here is using the React framework, which is

**[04:23]** using the React framework, which is

**[04:23]** using the React framework, which is basically a a framework for building

**[04:25]** basically a a framework for building

**[04:25]** basically a a framework for building agents that instructs the agent to

**[04:28]** agents that instructs the agent to

**[04:28]** agents that instructs the agent to reason, act, reason, act until it

**[04:31]** reason, act, reason, act until it

**[04:31]** reason, act, reason, act until it determines that it's come up with a

**[04:32]** determines that it's come up with a

**[04:32]** determines that it's come up with a final answer. The agent has access to

**[04:35]** final answer. The agent has access to

**[04:36]** final answer. The agent has access to tools, which are basically a set of

**[04:37]** tools, which are basically a set of

**[04:37]** tools, which are basically a set of functions. These could be external

**[04:39]** functions. These could be external

**[04:39]** functions. These could be external services. It's calling code in your

**[04:41]** services. It's calling code in your

**[04:41]** services. It's calling code in your codebase that it's running. So

**[04:43]** codebase that it's running. So

**[04:44]** codebase that it's running. So effectively an agent is just an LLM

**[04:46]** effectively an agent is just an LLM

**[04:46]** effectively an agent is just an LLM wrapped in an execution loop that can

**[04:48]** wrapped in an execution loop that can

**[04:48]** wrapped in an execution loop that can read, decide, call tools, and

**[04:52]** read, decide, call tools, and

**[04:52]** read, decide, call tools, and self-verify.

**[04:54]** self-verify.

**[04:54]** self-verify. So here you see, like I said, I have the

**[04:55]** So here you see, like I said, I have the

**[04:55]** So here you see, like I said, I have the start of a basic agent. I'm defining a

**[04:57]** start of a basic agent. I'm defining a

**[04:57]** start of a basic agent. I'm defining a set of tools for that agent. In this

**[04:59]** set of tools for that agent. In this

**[04:59]** set of tools for that agent. In this case, it has one. It's a calculator as


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** case, it has one. It's a calculator as

**[05:01]** case, it has one. It's a calculator as well as a function to actually calculate

**[05:03]** well as a function to actually calculate

**[05:03]** well as a function to actually calculate something.

**[05:05]** something.

**[05:05]** something. I initialize a system prompt here for

**[05:07]** I initialize a system prompt here for

**[05:07]** I initialize a system prompt here for the agent using the React framework.

**[05:14]** And I know there's a lot here, but

**[05:14]** And I know there's a lot here, but basically what this is is I'm defining

**[05:16]** basically what this is is I'm defining

**[05:16]** basically what this is is I'm defining that agent loop. It's a for loop, like

**[05:19]** that agent loop. It's a for loop, like

**[05:19]** that agent loop. It's a for loop, like I'm sure many of us learned in CS 101,

**[05:21]** I'm sure many of us learned in CS 101,

**[05:21]** I'm sure many of us learned in CS 101, and a number of maximum iterations so

**[05:23]** and a number of maximum iterations so

**[05:23]** and a number of maximum iterations so our agent can't get stuck in a loop

**[05:24]** our agent can't get stuck in a loop

**[05:24]** our agent can't get stuck in a loop thinking forever burning up our our

**[05:26]** thinking forever burning up our our

**[05:26]** thinking forever burning up our our OpenAI costs.

**[05:28]** OpenAI costs.

**[05:28]** OpenAI costs. The LLM tells our logic when it decides

**[05:31]** The LLM tells our logic when it decides

**[05:31]** The LLM tells our logic when it decides that a tool needs to be invoked. We call

**[05:33]** that a tool needs to be invoked. We call

**[05:34]** that a tool needs to be invoked. We call that tool. We pass the result back to

**[05:35]** that tool. We pass the result back to

**[05:36]** that tool. We pass the result back to the LLM and it decides when a final

**[05:39]** the LLM and it decides when a final

**[05:39]** the LLM and it decides when a final answer has been reached. We detect that

**[05:40]** answer has been reached. We detect that

**[05:40]** answer has been reached. We detect that and we spit it back out to the user.

**[05:43]** and we spit it back out to the user.

**[05:44]** and we spit it back out to the user. So building agents is easy, right? We

**[05:45]** So building agents is easy, right? We

**[05:45]** So building agents is easy, right? We can all just go build agents at our

**[05:47]** can all just go build agents at our

**[05:47]** can all just go build agents at our company and problem solved, right? Not

**[05:49]** company and problem solved, right? Not

**[05:50]** company and problem solved, right? Not so fast. Just like vibe coding, agents

**[05:53]** so fast. Just like vibe coding, agents

**[05:53]** so fast. Just like vibe coding, agents are tough to get into production in the

**[05:55]** are tough to get into production in the

**[05:55]** are tough to get into production in the same way that say a web app that you

**[05:57]** same way that say a web app that you

**[05:57]** same way that say a web app that you build and cursor really really quickly

**[05:59]** build and cursor really really quickly

**[05:59]** build and cursor really really quickly is tough to get into production. You


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:49]** We've also learned firsthand at retool

**[06:49]** We've also learned firsthand at retool that there's a lot that you really have

**[06:50]** that there's a lot that you really have

**[06:50]** that there's a lot that you really have to get right when you build agents.

**[06:53]** to get right when you build agents.

**[06:53]** to get right when you build agents. models can hallucinate or give you

**[06:56]** models can hallucinate or give you

**[06:56]** models can hallucinate or give you unpredictable results or inaccurate

**[06:57]** unpredictable results or inaccurate

**[06:57]** unpredictable results or inaccurate results, madeup results. You have to you


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** results, madeup results. You have to you

**[07:00]** results, madeup results. You have to you have to be mindful of security. You have

**[07:02]** have to be mindful of security. You have

**[07:02]** have to be mindful of security. You have to be conscious of the things that

**[07:05]** to be conscious of the things that

**[07:05]** to be conscious of the things that you're giving your agent access to.

**[07:08]** you're giving your agent access to.

**[07:08]** you're giving your agent access to. You have to be cognizant of cost

**[07:10]** You have to be cognizant of cost

**[07:10]** You have to be cognizant of cost overruns. It can be really uh easy to

**[07:12]** overruns. It can be really uh easy to

**[07:12]** overruns. It can be really uh easy to accidentally burn up a bunch of tokens.

**[07:15]** accidentally burn up a bunch of tokens.

**[07:15]** accidentally burn up a bunch of tokens. And overall, eval are really an

**[07:17]** And overall, eval are really an

**[07:17]** And overall, eval are really an important safeguard here in making your

**[07:19]** important safeguard here in making your

**[07:19]** important safeguard here in making your non-deterministic agent as deterministic

**[07:22]** non-deterministic agent as deterministic

**[07:22]** non-deterministic agent as deterministic as you can.

**[07:28]** So, how do you solve that problem? I

**[07:28]** So, how do you solve that problem? I would kind of group the options into

**[07:30]** would kind of group the options into

**[07:30]** would kind of group the options into approximately four buckets. The first is

**[07:33]** approximately four buckets. The first is

**[07:33]** approximately four buckets. The first is to build your agent from scratch. You

**[07:35]** to build your agent from scratch. You

**[07:35]** to build your agent from scratch. You write every line of code by hand. Maybe

**[07:37]** write every line of code by hand. Maybe

**[14:47]** retools core internal logic that they

**[14:47]** retools core internal logic that they want to build themselves and what's

**[14:49]** want to build themselves and what's

**[14:49]** want to build themselves and what's something they might look to use their

**[14:50]** something they might look to use their

**[14:50]** something they might look to use their own product for their own agent for

**[14:52]** own product for their own agent for

**[14:52]** own product for their own agent for that's a really good question I think

**[14:54]** that's a really good question I think

**[14:54]** that's a really good question I think like this is like generally a philosophy

**[14:56]** like this is like generally a philosophy

**[14:56]** like this is like generally a philosophy at retool we have just you know uh we we

**[14:58]** at retool we have just you know uh we we

**[14:58]** at retool we have just you know uh we we build a lot of our own internal software


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** build a lot of our own internal software

**[15:00]** build a lot of our own internal software on on retool. Of course, we're like dog

**[15:02]** on on retool. Of course, we're like dog

**[15:02]** on on retool. Of course, we're like dog fooding as much as we can. Um, in terms

**[15:05]** fooding as much as we can. Um, in terms

**[15:05]** fooding as much as we can. Um, in terms of your second question, I would say

**[15:07]** of your second question, I would say

**[15:07]** of your second question, I would say it's a great question. Agents released

**[15:09]** it's a great question. Agents released

**[15:09]** it's a great question. Agents released last week like I said, so we're building

**[15:10]** last week like I said, so we're building

**[15:10]** last week like I said, so we're building as much as we can on it. I I think it

**[15:12]** as much as we can on it. I I think it

**[15:12]** as much as we can on it. I I think it remains to be seen what we'll do on the

**[15:14]** remains to be seen what we'll do on the

**[15:14]** remains to be seen what we'll do on the platform and what we'll build by hand. I

**[15:16]** platform and what we'll build by hand. I

**[15:16]** platform and what we'll build by hand. I think just our philosophy is to do as

**[15:18]** think just our philosophy is to do as

**[15:18]** think just our philosophy is to do as much as we possibly can using our own

**[15:20]** much as we possibly can using our own

**[15:20]** much as we possibly can using our own platform and if we can't do something

**[15:22]** platform and if we can't do something

**[15:22]** platform and if we can't do something then we should go figure out why and go

**[15:23]** then we should go figure out why and go

**[15:23]** then we should go figure out why and go build it. And so I think for us

**[15:25]** build it. And so I think for us

**[15:25]** build it. And so I think for us specifically I would say we're just

**[15:26]** specifically I would say we're just

**[15:26]** specifically I would say we're just going to use the platform itself for

**[15:28]** going to use the platform itself for

**[15:28]** going to use the platform itself for everything we possibly can.

**[15:31]** everything we possibly can.

**[15:31]** everything we possibly can. Thanks for the question.
