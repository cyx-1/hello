# From Hype to Habit: How We're Building an AI-First SaaS Company—While Still Shipping the Roadmap

**Speakers:** Rala and Dibsha from Sprout Social
**Channel:** AI Engineer
**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc

## Executive Summary

This talk provides a candid, real-time look at Sprout Social's AI transformation journey. The speakers argue that becoming "AI-first" isn't about having all the answers or following a perfect playbook—it's messy, full of tradeoffs, and looks different for every company. They present a practical three-dimensional framework for AI transformation: Strategy (what you prioritize), Ways of Working (how you build and adapt), and People (how teams evolve). The core tension every SaaS company faces is balancing shipping features for today's customer needs while investing in the AI-powered future. Success requires the discipline of an enterprise combined with the nimbleness of a startup, treating AI transformation as a multi-dimensional journey rather than a binary switch.

## Main Topics

### [00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=17s) - Introduction and Setting Expectations

- Sprout Social is in the "messy middle" of their own AI transformation
- No crystal-clear playbook exists for becoming an AI-first company
- AI transformation is hard, messy, full of tradeoffs, and looks different for every company
- This talk shares what's working, what's not, and a practical framework to guide transformation

### [01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=100s) - Defining "AI-First"

- AI-first is like "teenage sex"—everyone talks about it, no one really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it
- It's about evolving from AI features sprinkled into products to rethinking how you plan, build, and deliver value through an AI lens
- AI-first means putting AI at the center of your strategy—it's primarily a mindset shift
- Unlike previous tech shifts (cloud-first, mobile-first, DevOps), AI is disrupting all areas at once: product, architecture, people, process, ethics

### [02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=162s) - AI Transformation as a Multi-Dimensional Journey

- Being AI-first isn't binary—it's not like flipping a switch
- It's not about throwing everything out and rebuilding your company overnight
- It's a multi-dimensional journey and an evolution
- Where you are on the spectrum varies by company, but the key is knowing where you are and moving with purpose

### [03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=220s) - The Three-Dimensional Framework

**Three key dimensions for AI transformation:**

1. **Strategy** - What you prioritize and why
2. **Ways of Working** - How you build, ship, and adapt
3. **People** - How your teams evolve and the skills that define success

These three areas provide a way to make sense of the work ahead, whether you're just getting started or already deep into transformation.

### [04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=262s) - Dimension 1: Strategy Shift

**From AI-Enhanced to AI-First Strategy:**

- In the past: "Where can we add intelligence to an existing experience?" (sprinkling AI across products)
- AI-first question: "What new experiences can we deliver that weren't even possible before?"
- Being AI-first means reimagining what's possible and solving previously unsolvable problems in ways customers may not even imagine

### [05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=320s) - The Innovator's Dilemma in the AI Era

**The core tension:**

- You must ship features to meet customer needs today while investing in the future
- Overindex on the present → risk falling behind and missing the moment
- Focus only on future → risk disappointing customers, slowing revenue, and starving innovation
- AI makes the innovator's dilemma 10 times harder
- You need the discipline of an enterprise AND the curiosity and nimbleness of a startup running in parallel
- It's like "steering a ship and launching a rocket at the same time"
- At some point, you have to build a startup inside your own company

### [06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=387s) - Embracing Ambiguity in Planning

**Shifting from deterministic roadmaps:**

- Three-month roadmaps can feel stale in three weeks when capabilities evolve monthly
- Moving from deterministic roadmaps (knowing what you're building months in advance) to embracing ambiguity
- Learning and discovery are what shape the path forward
- The destination itself can evolve as you learn more about what's possible

### [07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=431s) - Design Philosophy: Unified AI Experiences

**Example: Wufill (health tracking app for puppies) and customer "Pineapples":**

- Traditional approach: Separate AI features owned by different teams (meals, activity, digestive insights, supplements)
- When customer says "I'm feeling kind of blah":
  - Meal-based response: "Maybe because you skipped breakfast" (narrow)
  - Digestive-based response: "Your poop seemed off today" (narrow)
  - AI-first unified response: "It might be the new kibble. Your activity seems to be going down over the days and your poop also seemed off today. Maybe pause this new supplement you're trying and see how you feel tomorrow."
- AI-first means not just smarter features with AI sprinkled in, but unification to generate broader value unlocked incrementally through your roadmap

### [08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=527s) - Dimension 2: Ways of Working

**Key shifts in how teams operate:**

- Evolution from reactive, ad hoc innovation to systematic processes
- How you work together, move fast, learn fast, and stay aligned through uncertainty

### [09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=569s) - Ritualized Discovery

**From ad hoc to deliberate innovation:**

- Historically: Reactive innovation—someone had an idea, tested in isolation, maybe did a spike, moved on (rarely became sustained strategic driver)
- In AI-first world: Fragmented discovery doesn't hold up when landscape moves so fast
- Treat discovery as a repeatable, deliberate process
- Build time into planning cycles for experimentation, hackathons, and learning in various forums
- Make discovery visible and actionable across company strategy

### [10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=630s) - MVPs for Learning

- Embrace mindset of MVPs not just to launch quickly, but to validate direction
- Assume not every bet will land—some features won't work as expected
- Failure is a feature, not a bug—it drives clarity through ambiguity

### [10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=653s) - Treating Process as Product

**Rethinking processes for AI era:**

- Many past processes were designed for predictable linear roadmaps with deterministic risks
- In AI-first world where timelines shift and capabilities evolve monthly, old processes don't hold up
- Introducing too many new processes at once backfires—creates overhead and drag
- Sprout learned this the hard way
- Solution: Treat process as a product—evaluate against outcomes
  - Does it create clarity of direction?
  - Does it unblock teams?
  - Does it help make better decisions faster?
- If answer is no, reiterate or cut it entirely
- When purposeful, process gives teams clarity and flow and becomes an accelerator

### [12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=737s) - Smart Velocity Over Speed

**Balancing speed with direction:**

- Execution is the mode; speed is paramount (from yesterday's keynotes)
- Move fast without clarity → chaos
- Clarity without momentum → stagnation
- Smart velocity = building the muscle to move fast with purpose
- Not just shipping for the sake of shipping, but working with clarity, momentum, and adaptability
- Smart velocity keeps us grounded and moving at the same time

### [13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=800s) - Dimension 3: People and Culture

**The most important piece:**

- If strategy sets direction and ways of working determine execution, people make it all real
- "Culture eats strategy for breakfast"
- Becoming AI-first isn't just tech transformation—it's mainly a cultural transformation
- Culture lives in people: how they think, work, lead, and feel
- Need to rethink what great talent looks like in the AI era—not just in AI team but across entire company

### [14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=843s) - Two Major Shifts in Talent

1. How talent is evolving in the AI era
2. How to scale AI fluency across the organization

### [14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=863s) - Evolution of AI Practitioners

**From deep specialists to T-shaped talent:**

- Past: What made AI practitioners great was deep specialization; being a generalist or visionary builder gave you an edge but wasn't critical for most roles
- Today: AI depth is still essential, but being a versatile visionary builder has become critical to success
- Investing in **T-shaped talent**: People with deep expertise who can also stretch wide, prototype quickly, collaborate fluidly across silos, and bring end-to-end systems to life
- "It's like Indiana Jones—not choosing between the professor and the adventurer, but combining them"
- Bringing deep specialization of the scholar into the jungle to uncover unimaginable possibilities

### [15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=937s) - Pathfinders Who Navigate Ambiguity

- No playbook exists; technology evolves fast; roadmap keeps shifting
- Need pathfinders: people who can hold to their deep expertise while forging new ways through shifting terrain
- In most cases, the path doesn't even exist—they have to imagine it first
- Visionary thinking becomes a core skill
- Shift from shipping what's known to charting what's newly possible defines the next generation of AI builders

### [16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=987s) - Scaling AI Fluency Across the Organization

**Building organizational AI fluency:**

- Evolving builders is only part of the story
- Can't go AI-first if rest of company is still "AI-last"
- In AI-first company, everyone touches AI—from marketers and designers to PMs and care agents
- Goal: Every team feels empowered to understand AI and confident enough to build with it

### [17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=1028s) - Enablement Initiatives

**Supporting organization-wide AI fluency:**

- AI newsletters and podcasts
- Cross-functional AI show-and-tells
- Empowering teams to use whatever AI tools help them work smarter
- Building self-service platforms to enable product and engineering teams to prototype and ship AI-powered features without deep involvement from AI team
- Goal is NOT to turn everyone into an AI expert, but to create a company where AI thinking and exploration is the default, not the exception

### [18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=1092s) - What Hasn't Changed: The Fundamentals

**Non-negotiables that remain:**

- Best AI features still solve customer problems—rooted in needs, not novelty of AI
- User experience, performance, reliability, trust remain non-negotiable in AI-first world
- Human creativity, human judgment, and human care remain central to how we lead, make decisions, and show up for teams and customers

### [18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=1133s) - Advice for Leaders

**If you're leading AI transformation:**

- Get honest about the tradeoffs
- Invest in people, not just models and agents
- Kill the roadmap if needed
- Be bold, learn out loud, and ship that weird idea

### [19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YGRcgZJ3yc&t=1158s) - Final Reflections

**The path forward:**

- This talk serves as a "flashlight in the maze"
- Becoming AI-first won't be a linear path and won't be perfect
- Good news: You don't need all the answers to get started—just the right questions and conviction to evolve
- The most transformative inventions in human history only became revolutionary when they became part of day-to-day life
- We're standing at the cusp of the next greatest revolution
- This is a profound privilege and honor—not just witnessing this moment, but having the opportunity and responsibility to shape it
- This isn't just a technological revolution—it's a human one
- Transformation takes time, grit, and patience to navigate setbacks, doubts, and growing pains
- "If it feels like a long road ahead, you're not alone, but we promise it's totally worth it"
