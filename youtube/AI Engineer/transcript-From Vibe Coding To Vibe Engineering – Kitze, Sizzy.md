**[01:18]** in a lot of ways to do front- end

**[01:18]** in a lot of ways to do front- end development. Another thing I'm working

**[01:20]** development. Another thing I'm working

**[01:20]** development. Another thing I'm working on, the test flight is almost live. I'm

**[01:22]** on, the test flight is almost live. I'm

**[01:22]** on, the test flight is almost live. I'm making a life OS which combines like all

**[01:24]** making a life OS which combines like all

**[01:30]** Um, this is like a full stack thing that

**[01:30]** Um, this is like a full stack thing that I'm working on. It's currently on sale.

**[01:32]** I'm working on. It's currently on sale.

**[01:32]** I'm working on. It's currently on sale. It's called zero to ship. And the last

**[01:34]** It's called zero to ship. And the last

**[01:34]** It's called zero to ship. And the last thing that I'm reviving, it's called

**[01:36]** thing that I'm reviving, it's called

**[01:36]** thing that I'm reviving, it's called Glink, which is like change logs, road

**[01:37]** Glink, which is like change logs, road

**[01:37]** Glink, which is like change logs, road map, a billion other things. So, without

**[01:40]** map, a billion other things. So, without

**[01:40]** map, a billion other things. So, without overwhelming you more about my bio and

**[01:42]** overwhelming you more about my bio and

**[01:42]** overwhelming you more about my bio and stuff, I really hope I'll get invited

**[01:43]** stuff, I really hope I'll get invited

**[01:43]** stuff, I really hope I'll get invited next year because I love it here for

**[01:45]** next year because I love it here for

**[01:45]** next year because I love it here for reasons like um networking and meeting

**[01:48]** reasons like um networking and meeting

**[01:48]** reasons like um networking and meeting people and teaching. It's great that

**[01:50]** people and teaching. It's great that

**[01:50]** people and teaching. It's great that you're laughing, right? But let's just

**[01:51]** you're laughing, right? But let's just

**[01:51]** you're laughing, right? But let's just discuss why are you here, right? You're

**[01:52]** discuss why are you here, right? You're

**[01:52]** discuss why are you here, right? You're here for learning and you're here for

**[01:55]** here for learning and you're here for

**[01:55]** here for learning and you're here for like networking and later after this

**[01:57]** like networking and later after this

**[01:57]** like networking and later after this you're definitely going to improve all

**[01:58]** you're definitely going to improve all

**[01:58]** you're definitely going to improve all of your skills later. All right. So what


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:01]** of your skills later. All right. So what

**[02:01]** of your skills later. All right. So what can you expect from my conference talks?

**[02:02]** can you expect from my conference talks?

**[02:02]** can you expect from my conference talks? If you haven't listened to any of my

**[02:03]** If you haven't listened to any of my

**[02:03]** If you haven't listened to any of my conference talks usually this was made

**[02:05]** conference talks usually this was made

**[02:05]** conference talks usually this was made by AI so it's completely wrong. So it's

**[02:06]** by AI so it's completely wrong. So it's

**[02:06]** by AI so it's completely wrong. So it's like 50% tweets and 40% pain and 30%

**[02:09]** like 50% tweets and 40% pain and 30%

**[02:09]** like 50% tweets and 40% pain and 30% reason to remember the name. So in 2017

**[02:12]** reason to remember the name. So in 2017

**[02:12]** reason to remember the name. So in 2017 I did this talk with the longest name

**[02:13]** I did this talk with the longest name

**[02:13]** I did this talk with the longest name ever. It's called navigating the

**[02:14]** ever. It's called navigating the

**[02:14]** ever. It's called navigating the hypdriven front-end development world

**[02:16]** hypdriven front-end development world

**[02:16]** hypdriven front-end development world without going insane. And um I've been

**[02:18]** without going insane. And um I've been

**[02:18]** without going insane. And um I've been talking about like how to navigate the

**[02:20]** talking about like how to navigate the

**[02:20]** talking about like how to navigate the front end um world then. Now it's even

**[02:23]** front end um world then. Now it's even

**[02:23]** front end um world then. Now it's even crazier. But we need to recap like all

**[02:24]** crazier. But we need to recap like all

**[02:24]** crazier. But we need to recap like all the things that happened since 2017. I

**[02:27]** the things that happened since 2017. I

**[02:27]** the things that happened since 2017. I don't um I don't see my speaker notes

**[02:30]** don't um I don't see my speaker notes

**[02:30]** don't um I don't see my speaker notes which is bad but we'll try to get by. So

**[02:32]** which is bad but we'll try to get by. So

**[02:32]** which is bad but we'll try to get by. So in other industries like in the vision

**[02:33]** in other industries like in the vision

**[02:33]** in other industries like in the vision pro you have like cloth collision on top

**[02:35]** pro you have like cloth collision on top

**[02:35]** pro you have like cloth collision on top of real life objects and whatever crazy

**[02:36]** of real life objects and whatever crazy

**[02:36]** of real life objects and whatever crazy stuff is happening here. In in here we

**[02:39]** stuff is happening here. In in here we

**[02:39]** stuff is happening here. In in here we have like some slicing of a mesh texture

**[02:41]** have like some slicing of a mesh texture

**[02:41]** have like some slicing of a mesh texture going around the ball and blah blah

**[02:43]** going around the ball and blah blah

**[02:43]** going around the ball and blah blah blah. whatever these waterfalls and and

**[02:45]** blah. whatever these waterfalls and and

**[02:45]** blah. whatever these waterfalls and and like all of these mesh like you can take

**[02:46]** like all of these mesh like you can take

**[02:46]** like all of these mesh like you can take a rock and just smush it into another

**[02:48]** a rock and just smush it into another

**[02:48]** a rock and just smush it into another rock and it magically kind of like

**[02:50]** rock and it magically kind of like

**[02:50]** rock and it magically kind of like blends itself and it forms this

**[02:51]** blends itself and it forms this

**[02:51]** blends itself and it forms this structure and it's freaking crazy. Here

**[02:52]** structure and it's freaking crazy. Here

**[02:52]** structure and it's freaking crazy. Here we can drag our mouse and just create

**[02:54]** we can drag our mouse and just create

**[02:54]** we can drag our mouse and just create buildings and streets and taxi cars

**[02:56]** buildings and streets and taxi cars

**[02:56]** buildings and streets and taxi cars spawn out of nowhere like we do

**[02:57]** spawn out of nowhere like we do

**[02:57]** spawn out of nowhere like we do generative whatever the hell this is and


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** generative whatever the hell this is and

**[03:16]** laugh but you're going to laugh at the next slide because this is what happened

**[03:18]** next slide because this is what happened

**[03:18]** next slide because this is what happened in front-end development it's been

**[03:19]** in front-end development it's been

**[03:19]** in front-end development it's been almost 10 years and this is where we at

**[03:21]** almost 10 years and this is where we at

**[03:21]** almost 10 years and this is where we at there's a warning saying that maybe

**[03:23]** there's a warning saying that maybe

**[03:23]** there's a warning saying that maybe you'll be able to style a select in

**[03:25]** you'll be able to style a select in

**[03:25]** you'll be able to style a select in 2037.

**[03:27]** 2037.

**[03:27]** 2037. This is still alive. It's a It's a

**[03:28]** This is still alive. It's a It's a

**[03:28]** This is still alive. It's a It's a freaking miracle. This is still alive.

**[03:30]** freaking miracle. This is still alive.

**[03:30]** freaking miracle. This is still alive. It's thriving. Actually, 15 million

**[03:31]** It's thriving. Actually, 15 million

**[03:31]** It's thriving. Actually, 15 million downloads. I set up like a calendar

**[03:33]** downloads. I set up like a calendar

**[03:33]** downloads. I set up like a calendar event to check if it's dead every year.

**[03:34]** event to check if it's dead every year.

**[03:34]** event to check if it's dead every year. It's It hasn't been dead yet. So, I'm

**[03:37]** It's It hasn't been dead yet. So, I'm

**[03:37]** It's It hasn't been dead yet. So, I'm going to keep checking CLI. Not only

**[03:39]** going to keep checking CLI. Not only

**[03:39]** going to keep checking CLI. Not only that they're not dead, they're actually

**[03:40]** that they're not dead, they're actually

**[03:40]** that they're not dead, they're actually thriving. You can drop images. First

**[03:43]** thriving. You can drop images. First

**[03:43]** thriving. You can drop images. First time I dropped an image in my terminal,

**[03:44]** time I dropped an image in my terminal,

**[03:44]** time I dropped an image in my terminal, I'm like, how the heck never mind. Like,

**[03:46]** I'm like, how the heck never mind. Like,

**[03:46]** I'm like, how the heck never mind. Like, it's too [laughter]

**[03:48]** it's too [laughter]

**[03:48]** it's too [laughter] I I I added another calendar event. At

**[03:50]** I I I added another calendar event. At

**[03:50]** I I I added another calendar event. At this point, I have more events for this

**[03:52]** this point, I have more events for this

**[03:52]** this point, I have more events for this than anniversaries and birthdays and

**[03:53]** than anniversaries and birthdays and

**[03:53]** than anniversaries and birthdays and stuff. So, I I hope one day it's going

**[03:55]** stuff. So, I I hope one day it's going

**[03:55]** stuff. So, I I hope one day it's going to die as a concept. We're struggling

**[03:56]** to die as a concept. We're struggling

**[03:56]** to die as a concept. We're struggling with the same old pains. Soon in maybe

**[03:59]** with the same old pains. Soon in maybe

**[03:59]** with the same old pains. Soon in maybe some browsers, you won't need JavaScript


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** some browsers, you won't need JavaScript

**[04:00]** some browsers, you won't need JavaScript to style a popover in a dialogue. Can I

**[04:02]** to style a popover in a dialogue. Can I

**[04:02]** to style a popover in a dialogue. Can I have like a round of applause for that?

**[04:03]** have like a round of applause for that?

**[04:04]** have like a round of applause for that? Stop clapping because people have brain

**[04:06]** Stop clapping because people have brain

**[04:06]** Stop clapping because people have brain implants. All right, it doesn't matter

**[04:08]** implants. All right, it doesn't matter

**[04:08]** implants. All right, it doesn't matter if you can style a dialogue. We cannot

**[04:10]** if you can style a dialogue. We cannot

**[04:10]** if you can style a dialogue. We cannot read again get rid of Internet Explorer.

**[04:12]** read again get rid of Internet Explorer.

**[04:12]** read again get rid of Internet Explorer. We just updated the logo. It's still

**[04:15]** We just updated the logo. It's still

**[04:15]** We just updated the logo. It's still there. It's still painful. And uh yeah,

**[04:18]** there. It's still painful. And uh yeah,

**[04:18]** there. It's still painful. And uh yeah, we cannot agree on a way to increase a

**[04:19]** we cannot agree on a way to increase a

**[04:20]** we cannot agree on a way to increase a counter. This is a demo from Ryan

**[04:21]** counter. This is a demo from Ryan

**[04:21]** counter. This is a demo from Ryan Florence. This is remix version two, the

**[04:23]** Florence. This is remix version two, the

**[04:23]** Florence. This is remix version two, the version three, the remix or the version

**[04:24]** version three, the remix or the version

**[04:24]** version three, the remix or the version 4. Whatever they're doing, it's a

**[04:26]** 4. Whatever they're doing, it's a

**[04:26]** 4. Whatever they're doing, it's a counter. How complex is it to increase a

**[04:28]** counter. How complex is it to increase a

**[04:28]** counter. How complex is it to increase a counter? It's incredible. And don't

**[04:30]** counter? It's incredible. And don't

**[04:30]** counter? It's incredible. And don't shoot the messenger here, but the number

**[04:31]** shoot the messenger here, but the number

**[04:31]** shoot the messenger here, but the number one library, it's still the same. It's

**[04:33]** one library, it's still the same. It's

**[04:33]** one library, it's still the same. It's annoying, but React is the best and blah

**[04:35]** annoying, but React is the best and blah

**[04:35]** annoying, but React is the best and blah blah blah. So, let's talk about LM. LM

**[04:37]** blah blah. So, let's talk about LM. LM

**[04:37]** blah blah. So, let's talk about LM. LM are amazing at writing React. And this

**[04:39]** are amazing at writing React. And this

**[04:39]** are amazing at writing React. And this is funny only to us humans, right? To an

**[04:42]** is funny only to us humans, right? To an

**[04:42]** is funny only to us humans, right? To an LLM, this is like perfectly written

**[04:44]** LLM, this is like perfectly written

**[04:44]** LLM, this is like perfectly written code. It's like it's only a human wish

**[04:45]** code. It's like it's only a human wish

**[04:45]** code. It's like it's only a human wish to abstract the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of this, right?

**[04:47]** to abstract the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of this, right?

**[04:47]** to abstract the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of this, right? So when we see this, you get this. You

**[04:49]** So when we see this, you get this. You

**[04:49]** So when we see this, you get this. You want to get on stage right now like,

**[04:50]** want to get on stage right now like,

**[04:50]** want to get on stage right now like, "Oh, let me just change that. I'll make

**[04:51]** "Oh, let me just change that. I'll make

**[04:51]** "Oh, let me just change that. I'll make it more optimal." So here are some

**[04:53]** it more optimal." So here are some

**[04:53]** it more optimal." So here are some scientific brain scans. This is our

**[04:55]** scientific brain scans. This is our

**[04:55]** scientific brain scans. This is our brain on cocaine. This is our brain on

**[04:56]** brain on cocaine. This is our brain on

**[04:56]** brain on cocaine. This is our brain on sugar. This our brain when you realize

**[04:58]** sugar. This our brain when you realize

**[04:58]** sugar. This our brain when you realize it, we can abstract something. We're

**[04:59]** it, we can abstract something. We're

**[04:59]** it, we can abstract something. We're like, "Oh, let's go. It's useless to the


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** like, "Oh, let's go. It's useless to the

**[05:01]** like, "Oh, let's go. It's useless to the user, but we freaking love it." Um, so

**[05:04]** user, but we freaking love it." Um, so

**[05:04]** user, but we freaking love it." Um, so coding with LLMs makes this kind of

**[05:05]** coding with LLMs makes this kind of

**[05:05]** coding with LLMs makes this kind of better and worse. Like especially with

**[05:07]** better and worse. Like especially with

**[05:07]** better and worse. Like especially with Composer One, for me, it's like way

**[05:08]** Composer One, for me, it's like way

**[05:08]** Composer One, for me, it's like way worse because you can get to the right

**[05:10]** worse because you can get to the right

**[05:10]** worse because you can get to the right abstraction quicker, but you can also

**[05:11]** abstraction quicker, but you can also

**[05:12]** abstraction quicker, but you can also get to the wrong abstraction quicker.

**[05:13]** get to the wrong abstraction quicker.

**[05:13]** get to the wrong abstraction quicker. And the best thing here is LLMs don't

**[05:16]** And the best thing here is LLMs don't

**[05:16]** And the best thing here is LLMs don't care about repetitive code. And I've

**[05:17]** care about repetitive code. And I've

**[05:17]** care about repetitive code. And I've been seeing this since 2017 that we care

**[05:19]** been seeing this since 2017 that we care

**[05:20]** been seeing this since 2017 that we care too much about repetitive code and we

**[05:21]** too much about repetitive code and we

**[05:21]** too much about repetitive code and we abstract too early. So I'm going to

**[05:23]** abstract too early. So I'm going to

**[05:23]** abstract too early. So I'm going to repeat this a couple of times and I love

**[05:24]** repeat this a couple of times and I love

**[05:24]** repeat this a couple of times and I love that LLMs don't care about repetitive

**[05:27]** that LLMs don't care about repetitive

**[05:27]** that LLMs don't care about repetitive code. So LLM are also good at writing

**[05:29]** code. So LLM are also good at writing

**[05:29]** code. So LLM are also good at writing React because no one is actually good at

**[05:31]** React because no one is actually good at

**[05:31]** React because no one is actually good at writing React. You go to a React

**[05:32]** writing React. You go to a React

**[05:32]** writing React. You go to a React conference, every conference that I went

**[05:34]** conference, every conference that I went

**[05:34]** conference, every conference that I went to, like you just listen to the first

**[05:36]** to, like you just listen to the first

**[05:36]** to, like you just listen to the first talk and you're like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it can

**[05:37]** talk and you're like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it can

**[05:37]** talk and you're like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it can do that. I was using it all wrong." So

**[05:39]** do that. I was using it all wrong." So

**[05:39]** do that. I was using it all wrong." So everyone is just inventing their own

**[05:41]** everyone is just inventing their own

**[05:41]** everyone is just inventing their own ways of doing React. So when we say like

**[05:43]** ways of doing React. So when we say like

**[05:43]** ways of doing React. So when we say like yeah but you cannot do the optimal use

**[05:44]** yeah but you cannot do the optimal use

**[05:44]** yeah but you cannot do the optimal use effect blah blah blah and the machines

**[05:45]** effect blah blah blah and the machines

**[05:45]** effect blah blah blah and the machines cannot write the proper can you write a

**[05:47]** cannot write the proper can you write a

**[05:47]** cannot write the proper can you write a proper use effect no you can't so we

**[05:50]** proper use effect no you can't so we

**[05:50]** proper use effect no you can't so we should stop blaming the machines. So

**[05:51]** should stop blaming the machines. So

**[05:51]** should stop blaming the machines. So let's talk about this I think this is

**[05:53]** let's talk about this I think this is

**[05:53]** let's talk about this I think this is the very wrongest audience for my talk

**[05:55]** the very wrongest audience for my talk

**[05:55]** the very wrongest audience for my talk here because I've been giving this talk

**[05:56]** here because I've been giving this talk

**[05:56]** here because I've been giving this talk at conferences where people are like at

**[05:58]** at conferences where people are like at

**[05:58]** at conferences where people are like at least 50/50 hate vibe coding and love


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** least 50/50 hate vibe coding and love

**[06:00]** least 50/50 hate vibe coding and love vip coding. So I'm going to I I hope it

**[06:02]** vip coding. So I'm going to I I hope it

**[06:02]** vip coding. So I'm going to I I hope it will work here. So raise your hand if

**[06:03]** will work here. So raise your hand if

**[06:04]** will work here. So raise your hand if you think that vibe coding rocks.

**[06:06]** you think that vibe coding rocks.

**[06:06]** you think that vibe coding rocks. Okay that's way too many hands. You

**[06:08]** Okay that's way too many hands. You

**[06:08]** Okay that's way too many hands. You should have seen them this in another

**[06:09]** should have seen them this in another

**[06:09]** should have seen them this in another city just two people and everyone else

**[06:10]** city just two people and everyone else

**[06:10]** city just two people and everyone else is grumpy. So raise your hand if you

**[06:12]** is grumpy. So raise your hand if you

**[06:12]** is grumpy. So raise your hand if you think that VIP coding sucks. Please

**[06:13]** think that VIP coding sucks. Please

**[06:13]** think that VIP coding sucks. Please couple of hands. Hell yeah. All right.

**[06:15]** couple of hands. Hell yeah. All right.

**[06:15]** couple of hands. Hell yeah. All right. So I'm here to convince the rest of the

**[06:16]** So I'm here to convince the rest of the

**[06:16]** So I'm here to convince the rest of the group and hopefully people watching in a

**[06:18]** group and hopefully people watching in a

**[06:18]** group and hopefully people watching in a live stream. There's way more skeptical

**[06:19]** live stream. There's way more skeptical

**[06:19]** live stream. There's way more skeptical people. You have no if you just landed

**[06:21]** people. You have no if you just landed

**[06:21]** people. You have no if you just landed on Earth maybe and you don't know what

**[06:23]** on Earth maybe and you don't know what

**[06:23]** on Earth maybe and you don't know what vibe coding is. Okay. Zero people here.

**[06:25]** vibe coding is. Okay. Zero people here.

**[06:25]** vibe coding is. Okay. Zero people here. So yeah. All right. All of you are right

**[06:27]** So yeah. All right. All of you are right

**[06:27]** So yeah. All right. All of you are right because we're kind of vibe uh vibing the

**[06:30]** because we're kind of vibe uh vibing the

**[06:30]** because we're kind of vibe uh vibing the definition of what vibe coding is. And

**[06:31]** definition of what vibe coding is. And

**[06:31]** definition of what vibe coding is. And since the word was mentioned, we kind of

**[06:33]** since the word was mentioned, we kind of

**[06:33]** since the word was mentioned, we kind of expanded it to mean like everything and

**[06:35]** expanded it to mean like everything and

**[06:35]** expanded it to mean like everything and and anything. So the term vibe coding

**[06:37]** and anything. So the term vibe coding

**[06:37]** and anything. So the term vibe coding was coined by Andre Kapati. You probably

**[06:38]** was coined by Andre Kapati. You probably

**[06:38]** was coined by Andre Kapati. You probably know this. He's the reason that idiots

**[06:39]** know this. He's the reason that idiots

**[06:39]** know this. He's the reason that idiots sleep in the back of their cars and film

**[06:41]** sleep in the back of their cars and film

**[06:41]** sleep in the back of their cars and film Tik Toks. So he wrote this long essay on

**[06:43]** Tik Toks. So he wrote this long essay on

**[06:44]** Tik Toks. So he wrote this long essay on what is VIP coding. But a long story

**[06:45]** what is VIP coding. But a long story

**[06:45]** what is VIP coding. But a long story short, he's like you don't care that

**[06:46]** short, he's like you don't care that

**[06:46]** short, he's like you don't care that much about the code. You press accept

**[06:48]** much about the code. You press accept

**[06:48]** much about the code. You press accept and you just tell the LM to do what it

**[06:49]** and you just tell the LM to do what it

**[06:49]** and you just tell the LM to do what it needs to do and blah blah blah. Now this

**[06:52]** needs to do and blah blah blah. Now this

**[06:52]** needs to do and blah blah blah. Now this is a slide from my talk in 2017 when I

**[06:54]** is a slide from my talk in 2017 when I

**[06:54]** is a slide from my talk in 2017 when I before LLMs or anything was mentioned

**[06:55]** before LLMs or anything was mentioned

**[06:56]** before LLMs or anything was mentioned when I said that if you see the pattern

**[06:57]** when I said that if you see the pattern

**[06:58]** when I said that if you see the pattern of where front-end development is going,

**[06:59]** of where front-end development is going,

**[06:59]** of where front-end development is going, one day is going to be like everyone is


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** one day is going to be like everyone is

**[07:01]** one day is going to be like everyone is working on things that are so similar

**[07:03]** working on things that are so similar

**[07:03]** working on things that are so similar that one day you'll be able to be like,

**[07:04]** that one day you'll be able to be like,

**[07:04]** that one day you'll be able to be like, "Hey, just give me new styles for the

**[07:06]** "Hey, just give me new styles for the

**[07:06]** "Hey, just give me new styles for the header or move this three pixels to the

**[07:07]** header or move this three pixels to the

**[07:07]** header or move this three pixels to the right." And people were laughing.

**[07:08]** right." And people were laughing.

**[07:08]** right." And people were laughing. They're like, "No, it's not going to get

**[07:09]** They're like, "No, it's not going to get

**[07:09]** They're like, "No, it's not going to get there." And literally, this is what

**[07:10]** there." And literally, this is what

**[07:10]** there." And literally, this is what we're doing with cursor and everything

**[07:11]** we're doing with cursor and everything

**[07:12]** we're doing with cursor and everything else. Right? I'm too lazy to go into

**[07:13]** else. Right? I'm too lazy to go into

**[07:13]** else. Right? I'm too lazy to go into Tailwind and just move it by by three

**[07:15]** Tailwind and just move it by by three

**[07:15]** Tailwind and just move it by by three pixels. So, I'm a time traveler. Um,

**[07:17]** pixels. So, I'm a time traveler. Um,

**[07:17]** pixels. So, I'm a time traveler. Um, managers have been vi coding forever.

**[07:19]** managers have been vi coding forever.

**[07:19]** managers have been vi coding forever. So, this is nothing new. So, they tell a

**[07:20]** So, this is nothing new. So, they tell a

**[07:20]** So, this is nothing new. So, they tell a developer to implement a new feature.

**[07:22]** developer to implement a new feature.

**[07:22]** developer to implement a new feature. [cheering and applause]

**[07:23]** [cheering and applause]

**[07:23]** [cheering and applause] The developer makes changes to the code.

**[07:26]** The developer makes changes to the code.

**[07:26]** The developer makes changes to the code. Uh, the manager then tests the app. The

**[07:28]** Uh, the manager then tests the app. The

**[07:28]** Uh, the manager then tests the app. The manager does not read the code. Well,

**[07:30]** manager does not read the code. Well,

**[07:30]** manager does not read the code. Well, actually, I'm going to drink water here,

**[07:31]** actually, I'm going to drink water here,

**[07:31]** actually, I'm going to drink water here, and you can just read the rest of this

**[07:32]** and you can just read the rest of this

**[07:32]** and you can just read the rest of this slide.

**[07:39]** Um,

**[07:39]** Um, this last one depends on whether you're

**[07:41]** this last one depends on whether you're

**[07:41]** this last one depends on whether you're like in the Balkcon area or or you're at

**[07:43]** like in the Balkcon area or or you're at

**[07:47]** insult you or not insult you. So, this

**[07:47]** insult you or not insult you. So, this is what managers have been doing

**[07:48]** is what managers have been doing

**[07:48]** is what managers have been doing forever. Basically, there's so many

**[07:50]** forever. Basically, there's so many

**[07:50]** forever. Basically, there's so many jokes about VIP coding being bad. My

**[07:52]** jokes about VIP coding being bad. My

**[07:52]** jokes about VIP coding being bad. My favorite one is a comparison to a

**[07:53]** favorite one is a comparison to a

**[07:53]** favorite one is a comparison to a casino. So in cazasino you buy chips.

**[07:55]** casino. So in cazasino you buy chips.

**[07:55]** casino. So in cazasino you buy chips. Here you buy tokens. You spin the slots

**[07:57]** Here you buy tokens. You spin the slots

**[07:57]** Here you buy tokens. You spin the slots or you press generate. You might hit the

**[07:59]** or you press generate. You might hit the

**[07:59]** or you press generate. You might hit the jackpot or nothing. You get a functional


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** jackpot or nothing. You get a functional

**[08:01]** jackpot or nothing. You get a functional full stack app or garbage. Flashing

**[08:03]** full stack app or garbage. Flashing

**[08:03]** full stack app or garbage. Flashing lights active animation. You're

**[08:05]** lights active animation. You're

**[08:05]** lights active animation. You're absolutely right. Great idea. I've got

**[08:07]** absolutely right. Great idea. I've got

**[08:07]** absolutely right. Great idea. I've got my own strategy. I'm a prompt engineer.

**[08:10]** my own strategy. I'm a prompt engineer.

**[08:10]** my own strategy. I'm a prompt engineer. All right. Sure. One more spin. I'll win

**[08:12]** All right. Sure. One more spin. I'll win

**[08:12]** All right. Sure. One more spin. I'll win it all back. One more prompt and the bug

**[08:13]** it all back. One more prompt and the bug

**[08:13]** it all back. One more prompt and the bug will disappear. Cuz you know it kind of

**[08:16]** will disappear. Cuz you know it kind of

**[08:16]** will disappear. Cuz you know it kind of hurts this comparison. It's very true.

**[08:18]** hurts this comparison. It's very true.

**[08:18]** hurts this comparison. It's very true. Cursor is always in profit. I hit the

**[08:20]** Cursor is always in profit. I hit the

**[08:20]** Cursor is always in profit. I hit the jackpot. I build assassin one day. And

**[08:22]** jackpot. I build assassin one day. And

**[08:22]** jackpot. I build assassin one day. And where did the last four hours go? and

**[08:23]** where did the last four hours go? and

**[08:23]** where did the last four hours go? and just writing prompts for something you

**[08:25]** just writing prompts for something you

**[08:25]** just writing prompts for something you could have done manually in 15 minutes.

**[08:26]** could have done manually in 15 minutes.

**[08:26]** could have done manually in 15 minutes. So Andre was trying to coin way too many

**[08:28]** So Andre was trying to coin way too many

**[08:28]** So Andre was trying to coin way too many terms. It didn't work after the first

**[08:29]** terms. It didn't work after the first

**[08:29]** terms. It didn't work after the first time. He tried to coin this one about

**[08:31]** time. He tried to coin this one about

**[08:31]** time. He tried to coin this one about half coding which is like kind of you're

**[08:33]** half coding which is like kind of you're

**[08:33]** half coding which is like kind of you're observing what the LLM does. And I am

**[08:35]** observing what the LLM does. And I am

**[08:35]** observing what the LLM does. And I am not half coding and I'm not vibe coding.

**[08:37]** not half coding and I'm not vibe coding.

**[08:37]** not half coding and I'm not vibe coding. I love this term that somebody coined on

**[08:39]** I love this term that somebody coined on

**[08:39]** I love this term that somebody coined on Twitter and I'm going to start using

**[08:40]** Twitter and I'm going to start using

**[08:40]** Twitter and I'm going to start using that one. It's called vibe engineering.

**[08:42]** that one. It's called vibe engineering.

**[08:42]** that one. It's called vibe engineering. When you're actually using agents to

**[08:44]** When you're actually using agents to

**[08:44]** When you're actually using agents to code all the time like you don't touch

**[08:45]** code all the time like you don't touch

**[08:45]** code all the time like you don't touch the code but you just look at your

**[08:46]** the code but you just look at your

**[08:46]** the code but you just look at your screen like h I'm going to catch you.

**[08:48]** screen like h I'm going to catch you.

**[08:48]** screen like h I'm going to catch you. You look like they dexter me. You're

**[08:49]** You look like they dexter me. You're

**[08:49]** You look like they dexter me. You're like ah something's fishy here. Why? So

**[08:51]** like ah something's fishy here. Why? So

**[08:52]** like ah something's fishy here. Why? So I I've vibe engineer over 15. I wouldn't

**[08:54]** I I've vibe engineer over 15. I wouldn't

**[08:54]** I I've vibe engineer over 15. I wouldn't even bother with half of these things if

**[08:56]** even bother with half of these things if

**[08:56]** even bother with half of these things if it wasn't for LLM and Aentic coding. So

**[08:59]** it wasn't for LLM and Aentic coding. So

**[08:59]** it wasn't for LLM and Aentic coding. So but I'm always suspicious of the code


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** but I'm always suspicious of the code

**[09:00]** but I'm always suspicious of the code because it was based on our code and is

**[09:03]** because it was based on our code and is

**[09:03]** because it was based on our code and is based on our our knowledge. So proof

**[09:05]** based on our our knowledge. So proof

**[09:05]** based on our our knowledge. So proof this is Gemini just going on a rant that

**[09:07]** this is Gemini just going on a rant that

**[10:34]** did this, you did that. All right, I'm test. I'm I'm not shutting up. I'm

**[10:36]** test. I'm I'm not shutting up. I'm

**[10:36]** test. I'm I'm not shutting up. I'm literally seeing my thinking process out

**[10:37]** literally seeing my thinking process out

**[10:38]** literally seeing my thinking process out loud. Like I see you've done this,

**[10:39]** loud. Like I see you've done this,

**[10:39]** loud. Like I see you've done this, you've done that, there's a bug. Then I

**[10:40]** you've done that, there's a bug. Then I

**[10:40]** you've done that, there's a bug. Then I jump in the code and I continue talking

**[10:42]** jump in the code and I continue talking

**[10:42]** jump in the code and I continue talking about what it implemented in the code.

**[10:43]** about what it implemented in the code.

**[10:44]** about what it implemented in the code. So, some of my problems like sometimes

**[10:45]** So, some of my problems like sometimes

**[10:45]** So, some of my problems like sometimes last up to five minutes and people are

**[10:47]** last up to five minutes and people are

**[10:47]** last up to five minutes and people are like, "Please fix this. Make me a

**[10:48]** like, "Please fix this. Make me a

**[10:48]** like, "Please fix this. Make me a million dollars. It doesn't work." So,

**[10:50]** million dollars. It doesn't work." So,

**[10:50]** million dollars. It doesn't work." So, this is um amazing and I would tell you

**[10:53]** this is um amazing and I would tell you

**[10:53]** this is um amazing and I would tell you which app I'm using, but I vip code in

**[10:55]** which app I'm using, but I vip code in

**[10:55]** which app I'm using, but I vip code in an app and I don't want to hurt my

**[10:56]** an app and I don't want to hurt my

**[10:56]** an app and I don't want to hurt my potential hypothetical sales. Um, use

**[10:59]** potential hypothetical sales. Um, use

**[10:59]** potential hypothetical sales. Um, use rules, docs, commands, and memories.


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:01]** rules, docs, commands, and memories.

**[11:01]** rules, docs, commands, and memories. Like, all of these terms are way too

**[11:02]** Like, all of these terms are way too

**[11:02]** Like, all of these terms are way too complex and there's way too many things

**[11:03]** complex and there's way too many things

**[11:03]** complex and there's way too many things to juggle, but it it cannot have your

**[11:06]** to juggle, but it it cannot have your

**[11:06]** to juggle, but it it cannot have your entire app context for now and it's not

**[11:09]** entire app context for now and it's not

**[11:09]** entire app context for now and it's not a a mind reader. So, without the right

**[11:11]** a a mind reader. So, without the right

**[11:11]** a a mind reader. So, without the right context, you will like fail most of the

**[11:13]** context, you will like fail most of the

**[11:13]** context, you will like fail most of the time. So this is like a VIP engineering

**[11:14]** time. So this is like a VIP engineering

**[11:14]** time. So this is like a VIP engineering example. This is some of my like

**[11:15]** example. This is some of my like

**[11:16]** example. This is some of my like screenshotted prompts of how I'm doing

**[11:17]** screenshotted prompts of how I'm doing

**[11:17]** screenshotted prompts of how I'm doing things. It's like a bunch of technical

**[11:19]** things. It's like a bunch of technical

**[11:19]** things. It's like a bunch of technical jargon and it's never like fix the app

**[11:21]** jargon and it's never like fix the app

**[11:21]** jargon and it's never like fix the app blah blah blah. And then on the VIP

**[11:22]** blah blah blah. And then on the VIP

**[11:22]** blah blah blah. And then on the VIP coding side, people are like move this

**[11:24]** coding side, people are like move this

**[11:24]** coding side, people are like move this entire thing to TypeScript and make no

**[11:25]** entire thing to TypeScript and make no

**[11:25]** entire thing to TypeScript and make no mistakes. Then you have another thing

**[11:27]** mistakes. Then you have another thing

**[11:27]** mistakes. Then you have another thing like this is another one. These are just

**[11:28]** like this is another one. These are just

**[11:28]** like this is another one. These are just random problems just to show you like

**[11:30]** random problems just to show you like

**[11:30]** random problems just to show you like how I I'm not talking only about the UI.

**[11:33]** how I I'm not talking only about the UI.

**[11:34]** how I I'm not talking only about the UI. I'm talking about the UI and some

**[11:35]** I'm talking about the UI and some patterns that need to be changed in the

**[11:36]** patterns that need to be changed in the

**[11:38]** code. And on the vibe coding side, it's

**[11:38]** code. And on the vibe coding side, it's like something like that and people

**[11:39]** like something like that and people

**[11:39]** like something like that and people expect results. [laughter]

**[11:42]** expect results. [laughter]

**[11:42]** expect results. [laughter] Then here we have again technical stuff

**[11:44]** Then here we have again technical stuff

**[11:44]** Then here we have again technical stuff like TRPC cud definition abstractions

**[11:46]** like TRPC cud definition abstractions

**[11:46]** like TRPC cud definition abstractions like things how you you're basically VIP

**[11:48]** like things how you you're basically VIP architecting how you want the thing to

**[11:49]** architecting how you want the thing to

**[11:49]** architecting how you want the thing to work and on the VIP coding side you have

**[11:51]** work and on the VIP coding side you have

**[11:51]** work and on the VIP coding side you have make me a million dollar app and make no

**[11:53]** make me a million dollar app and make no

**[11:53]** make me a million dollar app and make no mistakes. Um [snorts] when VIP coders

**[11:55]** mistakes. Um [snorts] when VIP coders read VIP engineering problems they have

**[11:56]** read VIP engineering problems they have

**[11:56]** read VIP engineering problems they have no idea what's going on. And I'm

**[11:58]** no idea what's going on. And I'm

**[11:58]** no idea what's going on. And I'm honestly amazed at people who don't know

**[11:59]** honestly amazed at people who don't know

**[11:59]** honestly amazed at people who don't know how to code but they've done a


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** how to code but they've done a

**[12:00]** how to code but they've done a functional thing. Kudos to you. I've

**[12:02]** functional thing. Kudos to you. I've

**[12:02]** functional thing. Kudos to you. I've noticed this spectrum in the community.

**[12:03]** noticed this spectrum in the community.

**[12:03]** noticed this spectrum in the community. There's like who loves VIP coding and

**[12:05]** There's like who loves VIP coding and

**[12:05]** There's like who loves VIP coding and who hates VIP coding. So you on one hand

**[12:07]** who hates VIP coding. So you on one hand

**[12:07]** who hates VIP coding. So you on one hand you have like juniors who are like hell

**[12:08]** you have like juniors who are like hell

**[12:08]** you have like juniors who are like hell yeah give me the thing I love to do my

**[12:10]** yeah give me the thing I love to do my

**[12:10]** yeah give me the thing I love to do my own SAS. Then you have like super senior

**[12:12]** own SAS. Then you have like super senior

**[12:12]** own SAS. Then you have like super senior people who are doing like libraries and

**[12:13]** people who are doing like libraries and

**[12:13]** people who are doing like libraries and frameworks and crazy things. You can see

**[12:15]** frameworks and crazy things. You can see

**[12:15]** frameworks and crazy things. You can see all of them on Twitter v coding. And

**[12:16]** all of them on Twitter v coding. And

**[12:16]** all of them on Twitter v coding. And then you have the majority in the

**[12:17]** then you have the majority in the

**[12:17]** then you have the majority in the middle. They're like this will never be

**[12:19]** middle. They're like this will never be

**[12:23]** hilarious. But it's a pattern. Do not give AI tools to your interns and

**[12:24]** give AI tools to your interns and

**[12:24]** give AI tools to your interns and juniors. People think these are perfect.

**[12:26]** juniors. People think these are perfect.

**[12:26]** juniors. People think these are perfect. I'm going to hire junior underpay them

**[12:27]** I'm going to hire junior underpay them

**[12:27]** I'm going to hire junior underpay them and give them an LLM. The equivalent of

**[12:29]** and give them an LLM. The equivalent of

**[12:36]** skeptical senior and you convince them

**[12:36]** skeptical senior and you convince them to do vibe engineering, you're going to

**[12:38]** to do vibe engineering, you're going to

**[12:38]** to do vibe engineering, you're going to get 10x results. The hard part is

**[12:39]** get 10x results. The hard part is

**[12:39]** get 10x results. The hard part is actually convincing them. So there's a

**[12:41]** actually convincing them. So there's a

**[12:59]** one-time tools like these are perfect

**[12:59]** one-time tools like these are perfect for pipe coding. If your experience and

**[13:21]** unlucky timing is you hear everyone like

**[13:21]** unlucky timing is you hear everyone like hyping a model. It happened I think with

**[13:22]** hyping a model. It happened I think with

**[13:24]** cloud code when it came out and everyone

**[13:24]** cloud code when it came out and everyone started shifting to cloud code from

**[13:32]** people caught that they actually kind of pulled the rug a little bit and they

**[13:33]** pulled the rug a little bit and they

**[13:33]** pulled the rug a little bit and they dumbed down the model so they can just

**[13:35]** dumbed down the model so they can just

**[13:35]** dumbed down the model so they can just scale and like one week later they're

**[13:36]** scale and like one week later they're

**[13:36]** scale and like one week later they're like oops we updated we commented out

**[13:38]** like oops we updated we commented out

**[13:38]** like oops we updated we commented out the line that dumbs dumb down the model

**[13:41]** the line that dumbs dumb down the model

**[13:41]** the line that dumbs dumb down the model and you might have been caught in that

**[13:42]** and you might have been caught in that

**[13:42]** and you might have been caught in that timing and this happened with like

**[13:43]** timing and this happened with like

**[13:43]** timing and this happened with like basically every provider not just cloud

**[13:45]** basically every provider not just cloud

**[13:45]** basically every provider not just cloud code. People are like uh instead of

### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** choice. This is a slide for like four 4

**[14:01]** choice. This is a slide for like four 4 months ago until now. We have like a

**[14:03]** months ago until now. We have like a

**[14:03]** months ago until now. We have like a billion more here to choose and it's a

**[14:05]** billion more here to choose and it's a

**[14:05]** billion more here to choose and it's a bit crazy. Um, if you ask me what's the

**[14:07]** bit crazy. Um, if you ask me what's the

**[14:07]** bit crazy. Um, if you ask me what's the best model, it's a different answer at

**[14:09]** best model, it's a different answer at

**[14:09]** best model, it's a different answer at 9:00 a.m. It's a different answer now. I

**[14:11]** 9:00 a.m. It's a different answer now. I

**[14:11]** 9:00 a.m. It's a different answer now. I should check Twitter. It's probably a

**[14:12]** should check Twitter. It's probably a

**[14:12]** should check Twitter. It's probably a different answer after this talk because

**[14:13]** different answer after this talk because

**[14:13]** different answer after this talk because it's crazy. And this has happened to

**[14:15]** it's crazy. And this has happened to

**[14:15]** it's crazy. And this has happened to four conferences so far where I'm done

**[14:17]** four conferences so far where I'm done

**[14:17]** four conferences so far where I'm done with my conference talk at the night.

**[14:18]** with my conference talk at the night.

**[14:18]** with my conference talk at the night. I'm closing my laptop and they introduce

**[14:20]** I'm closing my laptop and they introduce

**[14:20]** I'm closing my laptop and they introduce a new model and I have to add new

**[14:21]** a new model and I have to add new

**[14:21]** a new model and I have to add new slides. It's super annoying. Composer

**[14:23]** slides. It's super annoying. Composer

**[14:23]** slides. It's super annoying. Composer one for me changed everything and I

**[14:25]** one for me changed everything and I

**[14:25]** one for me changed everything and I absolutely love it. Who is like relying

**[14:27]** absolutely love it. Who is like relying

**[14:27]** absolutely love it. Who is like relying on composer one for most things? All

**[14:29]** on composer one for most things? All

**[14:29]** on composer one for most things? All right, I would say not enough people

**[14:31]** right, I would say not enough people

**[14:31]** right, I would say not enough people because this is literally shifted the

**[14:32]** because this is literally shifted the

**[14:32]** because this is literally shifted the definition of VIP coding and VIP

**[14:34]** definition of VIP coding and VIP

**[14:34]** definition of VIP coding and VIP engineering for me. It made me kind of

**[14:35]** engineering for me. It made me kind of

**[14:35]** engineering for me. It made me kind of realize that I missed coding because

**[14:38]** realize that I missed coding because

**[14:38]** realize that I missed coding because what I would do is I would let a model

**[14:39]** what I would do is I would let a model

**[14:39]** what I would do is I would let a model run like GPD5 codeex and it would take

**[14:42]** run like GPD5 codeex and it would take

**[14:42]** run like GPD5 codeex and it would take 37 years and my grandchildren will

**[14:43]** 37 years and my grandchildren will

**[14:43]** 37 years and my grandchildren will update me on on the result of the model

**[14:45]** update me on on the result of the model

**[14:45]** update me on on the result of the model and I would watch YouTube shorts or

**[14:47]** and I would watch YouTube shorts or

**[14:47]** and I would watch YouTube shorts or whatever until it's done. Now with

**[14:48]** whatever until it's done. Now with

**[14:48]** whatever until it's done. Now with composer one, I'm back in the driver's

**[14:50]** composer one, I'm back in the driver's

**[14:50]** composer one, I'm back in the driver's seat and I actually watch what the agent

**[14:52]** seat and I actually watch what the agent

**[14:52]** seat and I actually watch what the agent is doing and I can be like, "Stop. No,

**[14:53]** is doing and I can be like, "Stop. No,

**[14:53]** is doing and I can be like, "Stop. No, no, no, no, no. We do the other thing."

**[14:54]** no, no, no, no. We do the other thing."

**[14:54]** no, no, no, no. We do the other thing." So it feels like coding and it's like

**[14:56]** So it feels like coding and it's like

**[14:56]** So it feels like coding and it's like super instant. It's amazing. Um, but it

**[14:59]** super instant. It's amazing. Um, but it

**[14:59]** super instant. It's amazing. Um, but it only works if you're a VIP engineer and


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** only works if you're a VIP engineer and

**[15:00]** only works if you're a VIP engineer and you know what you're doing. If you're a

**[15:01]** you know what you're doing. If you're a

**[15:01]** you know what you're doing. If you're a VIP coder, you have no idea whether the

**[15:02]** VIP coder, you have no idea whether the

**[15:02]** VIP coder, you have no idea whether the model is right or wrong. You're just, it

**[15:04]** model is right or wrong. You're just, it

**[15:04]** model is right or wrong. You're just, it might be wrong fast. So, not that

**[15:06]** might be wrong fast. So, not that

**[15:06]** might be wrong fast. So, not that useful. The biggest problem for me is

**[15:08]** useful. The biggest problem for me is

**[15:08]** useful. The biggest problem for me is like abstractions just because you can.

**[15:09]** like abstractions just because you can.

**[15:10]** like abstractions just because you can. I was always an anti-abstraction person.

**[15:11]** I was always an anti-abstraction person.

**[15:11]** I was always an anti-abstraction person. I was like, copy paste things. If it

**[15:14]** works for for the user, it doesn't

**[15:14]** works for for the user, it doesn't matter. Now, I'm just every day trying

**[15:16]** matter. Now, I'm just every day trying

**[15:16]** matter. Now, I'm just every day trying to invent dumb abstractions. So, I I

**[15:19]** to invent dumb abstractions. So, I I

**[15:19]** to invent dumb abstractions. So, I I achieved in two weeks more than I

**[15:20]** achieved in two weeks more than I

**[15:20]** achieved in two weeks more than I achieved in last year. This was solely

**[15:21]** achieved in last year. This was solely
