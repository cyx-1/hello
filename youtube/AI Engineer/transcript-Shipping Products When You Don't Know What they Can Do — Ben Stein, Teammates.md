**[00:19]** cursing a lot. I didn't know if I would

**[00:19]** cursing a lot. I didn't know if I would get into the track if I actually

**[00:20]** get into the track if I actually

**[00:20]** get into the track if I actually published the curse words. Uh I'm one of

**[00:22]** published the curse words. Uh I'm one of

**[00:22]** published the curse words. Uh I'm one of the founders of teammates. I'm going to

**[00:24]** the founders of teammates. I'm going to

**[00:24]** the founders of teammates. I'm going to wear my product manager hat today. I'm

**[00:27]** wear my product manager hat today. I'm

**[00:27]** wear my product manager hat today. I'm assuming this room is like mostly

**[00:28]** assuming this room is like mostly

**[00:28]** assuming this room is like mostly product folks, probably product minded

**[00:30]** product folks, probably product minded

**[00:30]** product folks, probably product minded engineers as well. Um, but I'm going to

**[00:32]** engineers as well. Um, but I'm going to

**[00:32]** engineers as well. Um, but I'm going to just like wear the product hat. Um, a

**[00:35]** just like wear the product hat. Um, a

**[00:35]** just like wear the product hat. Um, a little bit about teammates very quickly.

**[00:37]** little bit about teammates very quickly.

**[00:37]** little bit about teammates very quickly. We make uh a platform for designing and

**[00:39]** We make uh a platform for designing and

**[00:39]** We make uh a platform for designing and managing an entire digital workforce. So

**[00:41]** managing an entire digital workforce. So

**[00:42]** managing an entire digital workforce. So in AI engineer parliament, right? We're

**[00:43]** in AI engineer parliament, right? We're

**[00:43]** in AI engineer parliament, right? We're building agents. Um, but I would think

**[00:45]** building agents. Um, but I would think

**[00:45]** building agents. Um, but I would think of it like two ticks up from that

**[00:47]** of it like two ticks up from that

**[00:47]** of it like two ticks up from that because what we really believe it is the

**[00:49]** because what we really believe it is the

**[00:49]** because what we really believe it is the experience, the interaction patterns of

**[00:51]** experience, the interaction patterns of

**[00:51]** experience, the interaction patterns of humans and computers working together.

**[00:53]** humans and computers working together.

**[00:53]** humans and computers working together. So I want to talk to you about my

**[00:55]** So I want to talk to you about my

**[02:03]** pitch right she like shares Google docs

**[02:03]** pitch right she like shares Google docs Google sheets and she said hey or a

**[02:05]** Google sheets and she said hey or a

**[02:05]** Google sheets and she said hey or a customer said hey can I tag my teammate

**[02:12]** pause because I would like well I had

**[02:12]** pause because I would like well I had never actually thought about that before

**[02:13]** never actually thought about that before

**[02:13]** never actually thought about that before and so in the back of my mind I'm like

**[02:15]** and so in the back of my mind I'm like

**[02:15]** and so in the back of my mind I'm like well of course you can your question is

**[02:17]** well of course you can your question is

**[02:17]** well of course you can your question is like what's going to happen so I'm like

**[02:18]** like what's going to happen so I'm like

**[02:18]** like what's going to happen so I'm like okay so I'm like you know doing math in

**[02:19]** okay so I'm like you know doing math in

**[02:20]** okay so I'm like you know doing math in my head. I'm like, "Okay, well, we don't

**[02:22]** my head. I'm like, "Okay, well, we don't

**[02:22]** my head. I'm like, "Okay, well, we don't have web hooks. She probably won't or

**[02:23]** have web hooks. She probably won't or

**[02:23]** have web hooks. She probably won't or like a web hook from the comment. Okay,

**[02:25]** like a web hook from the comment. Okay,

**[02:25]** like a web hook from the comment. Okay, but she's going to get the email

**[02:26]** but she's going to get the email

**[02:26]** but she's going to get the email notification in the email that comes

**[02:28]** notification in the email that comes

**[02:35]** I'm like, I have no idea, right? I

**[02:35]** I'm like, I have no idea, right? I actually don't know what's going to

**[02:36]** actually don't know what's going to

**[02:36]** actually don't know what's going to happen. And this was like the impetus

**[02:38]** happen. And this was like the impetus

**[02:38]** happen. And this was like the impetus for this talk. I was like, how do I ship

**[02:41]** for this talk. I was like, how do I ship

**[02:41]** for this talk. I was like, how do I ship a product? How do I develop a product?

**[02:42]** a product? How do I develop a product?

**[02:42]** a product? How do I develop a product? How do I talk to customers? How do I

**[02:44]** How do I talk to customers? How do I

**[02:44]** How do I talk to customers? How do I instill trust when I don't know what my

**[02:46]** instill trust when I don't know what my

**[02:46]** instill trust when I don't know what my own product can do? And like it's really

**[02:50]** own product can do? And like it's really

**[02:50]** own product can do? And like it's really weird. And sometimes I'm like, well, is

**[02:52]** weird. And sometimes I'm like, well, is

**[02:52]** weird. And sometimes I'm like, well, is this just because I'm an idiot? And

**[02:53]** this just because I'm an idiot? And

**[02:53]** this just because I'm an idiot? And like, well, since it's my talk here, I'm

**[02:55]** like, well, since it's my talk here, I'm

**[02:55]** like, well, since it's my talk here, I'm gonna say no. And sometimes I'm like,

**[02:56]** gonna say no. And sometimes I'm like,

**[02:56]** gonna say no. And sometimes I'm like, well, is this because what we're

**[02:58]** well, is this because what we're

**[02:58]** well, is this because what we're building is so far out there, right?


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** building is so far out there, right?

**[03:00]** building is so far out there, right? These are like truly autonomous agents

**[03:02]** These are like truly autonomous agents

**[03:02]** These are like truly autonomous agents that can use any. And it's like, I don't

**[03:04]** that can use any. And it's like, I don't

**[03:04]** that can use any. And it's like, I don't think that's it either. I think what's

**[03:05]** think that's it either. I think what's

**[03:05]** think that's it either. I think what's happening is the product management

**[03:07]** happening is the product management

**[03:07]** happening is the product management discipline is going to undergo a

**[03:10]** discipline is going to undergo a

**[03:10]** discipline is going to undergo a transformation, a shift, an evolution,

**[03:11]** transformation, a shift, an evolution,

**[03:11]** transformation, a shift, an evolution, whatever you call it, that is super

**[03:13]** whatever you call it, that is super

**[03:13]** whatever you call it, that is super profound. And we may or may not totally

**[03:15]** profound. And we may or may not totally

**[03:15]** profound. And we may or may not totally realize it yet. Because I think in the

**[03:17]** realize it yet. Because I think in the

**[03:17]** realize it yet. Because I think in the engineering world we're like oh well we

**[03:18]** engineering world we're like oh well we

**[03:18]** engineering world we're like oh well we have uh you know tools in our IDEs and

**[03:20]** have uh you know tools in our IDEs and

**[03:20]** have uh you know tools in our IDEs and we have codegen and like we sort of are

**[03:22]** we have codegen and like we sort of are

**[03:22]** we have codegen and like we sort of are starting to squint at understanding

**[03:24]** starting to squint at understanding

**[03:24]** starting to squint at understanding maybe how the discipline is changing. I

**[03:27]** maybe how the discipline is changing. I

**[03:27]** maybe how the discipline is changing. I don't think we really understand how

**[03:30]** don't think we really understand how

**[03:30]** don't think we really understand how product development is changing and

**[03:32]** product development is changing and

**[03:32]** product development is changing and evolving and like what are the new tools

**[03:33]** evolving and like what are the new tools

**[03:33]** evolving and like what are the new tools and practices and how do we forget

**[03:34]** and practices and how do we forget

**[03:34]** and practices and how do we forget everything we've learned in the past.

**[03:38]** everything we've learned in the past.

**[03:38]** everything we've learned in the past. Um why is this true? Right? If it's if

**[03:40]** Um why is this true? Right? If it's if

**[03:40]** Um why is this true? Right? If it's if it the answer is not Ben's an idiot and

**[03:41]** it the answer is not Ben's an idiot and

**[03:41]** it the answer is not Ben's an idiot and the answer is uh not that we're way out

**[03:43]** the answer is uh not that we're way out

**[03:44]** the answer is uh not that we're way out there. It's two reasons. Number one, if

**[03:46]** there. It's two reasons. Number one, if

**[03:46]** there. It's two reasons. Number one, if all our products are built on top of

**[03:47]** all our products are built on top of

**[03:48]** all our products are built on top of LLMs and plus or minus they are like we

**[03:50]** LLMs and plus or minus they are like we

**[03:50]** LLMs and plus or minus they are like we don't know and we can never know what

**[03:52]** don't know and we can never know what

**[03:52]** don't know and we can never know what the LLMs know, right? So like inherently

**[03:54]** the LLMs know, right? So like inherently

**[03:54]** the LLMs know, right? So like inherently in what we're building is like we don't

**[03:56]** in what we're building is like we don't

**[03:56]** in what we're building is like we don't know what the foundation is. Like you

**[03:58]** know what the foundation is. Like you

**[03:58]** know what the foundation is. Like you don't have to know what your database

**[03:59]** don't have to know what your database

**[03:59]** don't have to know what your database like how it works but like you generally


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** like how it works but like you generally

**[04:00]** like how it works but like you generally know that it's like the surface area the

**[04:02]** know that it's like the surface area the

**[04:02]** know that it's like the surface area the interface that's exposed. We don't

**[04:04]** interface that's exposed. We don't

**[04:04]** interface that's exposed. We don't understand this for the the models. And

**[04:06]** understand this for the the models. And

**[04:06]** understand this for the the models. And the other thing is the expectations from

**[04:08]** the other thing is the expectations from

**[04:08]** the other thing is the expectations from customers are just boundless, right?

**[04:11]** customers are just boundless, right?

**[04:11]** customers are just boundless, right? We're just like hey here's a text box. I

**[04:12]** We're just like hey here's a text box. I

**[04:12]** We're just like hey here's a text box. I mean, that's probably not a good

**[04:13]** mean, that's probably not a good

**[04:13]** mean, that's probably not a good interface, but like essentially we're

**[04:14]** interface, but like essentially we're

**[04:14]** interface, but like essentially we're like, here's a free text box, and if

**[04:16]** like, here's a free text box, and if

**[04:16]** like, here's a free text box, and if it's anything other than like a help me

**[04:17]** it's anything other than like a help me

**[04:17]** it's anything other than like a help me write button, you're essentially

**[04:19]** write button, you're essentially

**[04:19]** write button, you're essentially inviting customers and users to just do

**[04:21]** inviting customers and users to just do

**[04:21]** inviting customers and users to just do whatever they want, right? So, we have

**[04:23]** whatever they want, right? So, we have

**[04:23]** whatever they want, right? So, we have this like boundless surface area built

**[04:26]** this like boundless surface area built

**[04:26]** this like boundless surface area built on top of a product that we don't

**[04:27]** on top of a product that we don't

**[04:27]** on top of a product that we don't understand. And so, the question now is

**[04:29]** understand. And so, the question now is

**[04:30]** understand. And so, the question now is like how do we adapt? So, let's me let

**[04:32]** like how do we adapt? So, let's me let

**[04:32]** like how do we adapt? So, let's me let me actually pick on this Google Doc

**[04:34]** me actually pick on this Google Doc

**[04:34]** me actually pick on this Google Doc comment thing for a second, right? So,

**[04:36]** comment thing for a second, right? So,

**[04:36]** comment thing for a second, right? So, if I was wearing my like traditional PM

**[04:38]** if I was wearing my like traditional PM

**[04:38]** if I was wearing my like traditional PM hat, I'm like, "Okay, well, I need to

**[04:40]** hat, I'm like, "Okay, well, I need to

**[04:40]** hat, I'm like, "Okay, well, I need to make a feature that's going to uh

**[04:44]** make a feature that's going to uh

**[04:44]** make a feature that's going to uh read and respond to Google Doc

**[04:46]** read and respond to Google Doc

**[04:46]** read and respond to Google Doc comments." And so, in my head, I'm like,

**[04:48]** comments." And so, in my head, I'm like,

**[04:48]** comments." And so, in my head, I'm like, "Okay, well, uh, does Stacy have access

**[04:51]** "Okay, well, uh, does Stacy have access

**[04:51]** "Okay, well, uh, does Stacy have access to the Google doc?" Uh, if she gets

**[04:53]** to the Google doc?" Uh, if she gets

**[04:53]** to the Google doc?" Uh, if she gets tagged in the comment, should she reply

**[04:55]** tagged in the comment, should she reply

**[04:55]** tagged in the comment, should she reply directly in the comment? Should she

**[04:57]** directly in the comment? Should she

**[04:57]** directly in the comment? Should she reply at all? What happens if somebody

**[04:59]** reply at all? What happens if somebody

**[04:59]** reply at all? What happens if somebody else comments in the thread? What if


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** else comments in the thread? What if

**[05:01]** else comments in the thread? What if someone comments in the thread that's

**[05:02]** someone comments in the thread that's

**[05:02]** someone comments in the thread that's not addressed to her? What if it's

**[05:03]** not addressed to her? What if it's

**[05:03]** not addressed to her? What if it's someone else? What if it's what if it's

**[05:05]** someone else? What if it's what if it's

**[05:05]** someone else? What if it's what if it's her doc and someone else commented to

**[05:07]** her doc and someone else commented to

**[05:08]** her doc and someone else commented to someone else but she gets the know like

**[05:09]** someone else but she gets the know like

**[05:09]** someone else but she gets the know like there's just so much to like think about

**[05:10]** there's just so much to like think about

**[05:10]** there's just so much to like think about and reason about and so I'm like okay

**[05:12]** and reason about and so I'm like okay

**[05:12]** and reason about and so I'm like okay well I'm not building a Google doc

**[05:15]** well I'm not building a Google doc

**[05:15]** well I'm not building a Google doc commenting product so I'm not going to

**[05:16]** commenting product so I'm not going to

**[05:16]** commenting product so I'm not going to speck all of those things out and like

**[05:19]** speck all of those things out and like

**[05:19]** speck all of those things out and like what's worse is like you also probably

**[05:21]** what's worse is like you also probably

**[05:21]** what's worse is like you also probably want to tag her in linear tickets right

**[05:23]** want to tag her in linear tickets right

**[05:23]** want to tag her in linear tickets right and what's what's the book like if you

**[05:25]** and what's what's the book like if you

**[05:25]** and what's what's the book like if you give a mouse a cookie right it's like if

**[05:26]** give a mouse a cookie right it's like if

**[05:26]** give a mouse a cookie right it's like if you give a mouse a cookie well you

**[05:27]** you give a mouse a cookie well you

**[05:27]** you give a mouse a cookie well you probably want to like tag her in Figma

**[05:29]** probably want to like tag her in Figma

**[05:29]** probably want to like tag her in Figma as well and you probably want to tag her

**[05:32]** as well and you probably want to tag her

**[05:32]** as well and you probably want to tag her in LinkedIn posts and like And so we're

**[05:34]** in LinkedIn posts and like And so we're

**[05:34]** in LinkedIn posts and like And so we're not a team that's building a generic

**[05:37]** not a team that's building a generic

**[05:37]** not a team that's building a generic commenting reply agent system, right? So

**[05:40]** commenting reply agent system, right? So

**[05:40]** commenting reply agent system, right? So then the question is like what are we

**[05:41]** then the question is like what are we

**[05:41]** then the question is like what are we supposed to do, right? As like a product

**[05:43]** supposed to do, right? As like a product

**[05:43]** supposed to do, right? As like a product manager who realizes, okay, I have this

**[05:45]** manager who realizes, okay, I have this

**[05:45]** manager who realizes, okay, I have this like boundless surface area. How does

**[05:47]** like boundless surface area. How does

**[05:47]** like boundless surface area. How does the practice need to change, right? And

**[05:49]** the practice need to change, right? And

**[05:49]** the practice need to change, right? And like sort of this is the core of like

**[05:50]** like sort of this is the core of like

**[05:50]** like sort of this is the core of like what I want to what I want to talk about

**[05:52]** what I want to what I want to talk about

**[05:52]** what I want to what I want to talk about today.

**[05:54]** today.

**[05:54]** today. So I'll do like three uh high flutin

**[05:56]** So I'll do like three uh high flutin

**[05:56]** So I'll do like three uh high flutin ivory tower ideas and then I'll talk

**[05:57]** ivory tower ideas and then I'll talk

**[05:57]** ivory tower ideas and then I'll talk through some like practical ways to to


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** through some like practical ways to to

**[06:00]** through some like practical ways to to make this real.

**[06:02]** make this real.

**[06:02]** make this real. So the first one is this mindset shift

**[06:04]** So the first one is this mindset shift

**[06:04]** So the first one is this mindset shift to like think in affordances and not

**[06:07]** to like think in affordances and not

**[06:07]** to like think in affordances and not like specific requirements. So it's not

**[06:09]** like specific requirements. So it's not

**[06:10]** like specific requirements. So it's not if you know as a user if Stacy replies

**[06:12]** if you know as a user if Stacy replies

**[06:12]** if you know as a user if Stacy replies in the comment thread and she has like

**[06:15]** in the comment thread and she has like

**[06:15]** in the comment thread and she has like that's not how we would think about it

**[06:16]** that's not how we would think about it

**[06:16]** that's not how we would think about it anymore. It's the affordance. Oh, she

**[06:18]** anymore. It's the affordance. Oh, she

**[06:18]** anymore. It's the affordance. Oh, she has affordances to comment or she has

**[06:20]** has affordances to comment or she has

**[06:20]** has affordances to comment or she has affordances to communicate or or to

**[06:22]** affordances to communicate or or to

**[06:22]** affordances to communicate or or to email or to collaborate. We're going to

**[06:24]** email or to collaborate. We're going to

**[06:24]** email or to collaborate. We're going to trust the LLMs. We're going to trust the

**[06:26]** trust the LLMs. We're going to trust the

**[06:26]** trust the LLMs. We're going to trust the agentic workflow, the work planning,

**[06:28]** agentic workflow, the work planning,

**[06:28]** agentic workflow, the work planning, like all of the things inside of our um

**[06:30]** like all of the things inside of our um

**[06:30]** like all of the things inside of our um you know, beautiful 12 factor agent.

**[06:32]** you know, beautiful 12 factor agent.

**[06:32]** you know, beautiful 12 factor agent. We're going to assume that that will

**[06:33]** We're going to assume that that will

**[06:33]** We're going to assume that that will understand, but it's the affordances

**[06:34]** understand, but it's the affordances

**[06:34]** understand, but it's the affordances that we need to think about, not the

**[06:36]** that we need to think about, not the

**[06:36]** that we need to think about, not the individual features, which is really

**[06:38]** individual features, which is really

**[06:38]** individual features, which is really weird and it's not typically how product

**[06:39]** weird and it's not typically how product

**[06:39]** weird and it's not typically how product people have ever thought before.

**[06:42]** people have ever thought before.

**[06:42]** people have ever thought before. And I would say actually this goes even

**[06:44]** And I would say actually this goes even

**[06:44]** And I would say actually this goes even further, which is behavior is emergent.

**[06:47]** further, which is behavior is emergent.

**[06:47]** further, which is behavior is emergent. And this was the other thing that I did

**[06:49]** And this was the other thing that I did

**[06:49]** And this was the other thing that I did not expect at all like starting in this

**[06:51]** not expect at all like starting in this

**[06:51]** not expect at all like starting in this space was uh we don't not only do we not

**[06:55]** space was uh we don't not only do we not

**[06:55]** space was uh we don't not only do we not know what things work sometimes they do

**[06:57]** know what things work sometimes they do

**[06:57]** know what things work sometimes they do and they work in ways we didn't expect

**[06:59]** and they work in ways we didn't expect

**[06:59]** and they work in ways we didn't expect and so I feel like our job as product


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** and so I feel like our job as product

**[07:01]** and so I feel like our job as product people is to discover functionality is

**[07:03]** people is to discover functionality is

**[07:03]** people is to discover functionality is what are the right building blocks right

**[07:05]** what are the right building blocks right

**[07:05]** what are the right building blocks right what are the right Lego bricks that we

**[07:07]** what are the right Lego bricks that we

**[07:07]** what are the right Lego bricks that we either give our engineering team our

**[07:10]** either give our engineering team our

**[07:10]** either give our engineering team our product our customers let them compose

**[07:12]** product our customers let them compose

**[07:12]** product our customers let them compose and can we discover emergent behavior

**[07:14]** and can we discover emergent behavior

**[07:14]** and can we discover emergent behavior and that is one of the reasons like this

**[07:16]** and that is one of the reasons like this

**[07:16]** and that is one of the reasons like this is the most exciting time I've ever

**[07:18]** is the most exciting time I've ever

**[07:18]** is the most exciting time I've ever built because we're actually building

**[07:19]** built because we're actually building

**[07:19]** built because we're actually building things and then discovering what they

**[07:20]** things and then discovering what they

**[07:20]** things and then discovering what they can do themselves. That sort of became

**[07:22]** can do themselves. That sort of became

**[07:22]** can do themselves. That sort of became the new job in a sense is discovering

**[07:25]** the new job in a sense is discovering

**[07:25]** the new job in a sense is discovering what's possible because if you asked me

**[07:26]** what's possible because if you asked me

**[07:26]** what's possible because if you asked me I could not sit down in front of a

**[07:28]** I could not sit down in front of a

**[07:28]** I could not sit down in front of a Google doc and be like oh let me like

**[07:29]** Google doc and be like oh let me like

**[07:29]** Google doc and be like oh let me like type out what this thing should I can't

**[07:31]** type out what this thing should I can't

**[07:31]** type out what this thing should I can't I don't know how to do it and well even

**[07:34]** I don't know how to do it and well even

**[07:34]** I don't know how to do it and well even if I could how do I then communicate it

**[07:36]** if I could how do I then communicate it

**[07:36]** if I could how do I then communicate it right so how do you we communicate to a

**[07:40]** right so how do you we communicate to a

**[07:40]** right so how do you we communicate to a development team to a backlog how do you

**[07:42]** development team to a backlog how do you

**[07:42]** development team to a backlog how do you communicate exactly what should be

**[07:43]** communicate exactly what should be

**[07:44]** communicate exactly what should be happening it's like Figma doesn't like

**[07:46]** happening it's like Figma doesn't like

**[07:46]** happening it's like Figma doesn't like have the affordances for this right my

**[07:48]** have the affordances for this right my

**[07:48]** have the affordances for this right my my PRD doesn't like have the affordance

**[07:50]** my PRD doesn't like have the affordance

**[07:50]** my PRD doesn't like have the affordance for Well, you should probably talk a

**[07:52]** for Well, you should probably talk a

**[07:52]** for Well, you should probably talk a little bit less gen alpha because you're

**[07:54]** little bit less gen alpha because you're

**[07:54]** little bit less gen alpha because you're making Ben feel old or like hey, you

**[07:55]** making Ben feel old or like hey, you

**[07:55]** making Ben feel old or like hey, you should be really like how do we

**[07:57]** should be really like how do we

**[07:57]** should be really like how do we communicate and express these these

**[07:59]** communicate and express these these

**[07:59]** communicate and express these these concepts, right? So, I think these are


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** concepts, right? So, I think these are

**[08:01]** concepts, right? So, I think these are like the three, you know, high level uh

**[08:04]** like the three, you know, high level uh

**[08:04]** like the three, you know, high level uh ways that um our practice needs to

**[08:06]** ways that um our practice needs to

**[08:06]** ways that um our practice needs to change, but like let's make it a little

**[08:08]** change, but like let's make it a little

**[08:08]** change, but like let's make it a little more concrete. Okay, so eval talk about

**[08:12]** more concrete. Okay, so eval talk about

**[08:12]** more concrete. Okay, so eval talk about evals. Okay, it's really hard to make a

**[08:15]** evals. Okay, it's really hard to make a

**[08:15]** evals. Okay, it's really hard to make a slide with graphics of evals. I feel bad

**[08:18]** slide with graphics of evals. I feel bad

**[08:18]** slide with graphics of evals. I feel bad for the eval like how do you ex

**[08:20]** for the eval like how do you ex

**[08:20]** for the eval like how do you ex illustrate an eval? So I'm going to make

**[08:21]** illustrate an eval? So I'm going to make

**[08:21]** illustrate an eval? So I'm going to make you just look at pictures of various

**[08:23]** you just look at pictures of various

**[08:23]** you just look at pictures of various teammates from a you know across all of

**[08:24]** teammates from a you know across all of

**[08:24]** teammates from a you know across all of our customers. Um okay who hates raising

**[08:28]** our customers. Um okay who hates raising

**[08:28]** our customers. Um okay who hates raising their hand at conferences when the

**[08:30]** their hand at conferences when the

**[08:30]** their hand at conferences when the speaker asked them? Okay awesome. So

**[08:32]** speaker asked them? Okay awesome. So

**[08:32]** speaker asked them? Okay awesome. So here's my question which is okay for the

**[08:34]** here's my question which is okay for the

**[08:34]** here's my question which is okay for the engineers here who like legit like don't

**[08:36]** engineers here who like legit like don't

**[08:36]** engineers here who like legit like don't lie like writes and runs their evals

**[08:41]** lie like writes and runs their evals

**[08:41]** lie like writes and runs their evals good number. And of the product people,

**[08:43]** good number. And of the product people,

**[08:43]** good number. And of the product people, who has visibility into the evals?

**[08:47]** who has visibility into the evals?

**[08:47]** who has visibility into the evals? There's a that's not bad. And and do you

**[08:50]** There's a that's not bad. And and do you

**[08:50]** There's a that's not bad. And and do you look at them just because you have the

**[08:51]** look at them just because you have the

**[08:51]** look at them just because you have the visibility? All right. One, one and a

**[08:53]** visibility? All right. One, one and a

**[08:53]** visibility? All right. One, one and a half. Two. Okay, great. So, I would

**[08:56]** half. Two. Okay, great. So, I would

**[08:56]** half. Two. Okay, great. So, I would posit that eval back up. Right. So, we

**[08:59]** posit that eval back up. Right. So, we

**[08:59]** posit that eval back up. Right. So, we all talk about eval. We're all going to


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** all talk about eval. We're all going to

**[09:00]** all talk about eval. We're all going to be embarrassed to say that we don't

**[09:01]** be embarrassed to say that we don't

**[09:01]** be embarrassed to say that we don't really know what they are. Evals are a

**[09:03]** really know what they are. Evals are a

**[09:03]** really know what they are. Evals are a testing framework for probabilistic AI

**[09:06]** testing framework for probabilistic AI

**[09:06]** testing framework for probabilistic AI for agents, right? Like if we think

**[09:08]** for agents, right? Like if we think

**[09:08]** for agents, right? Like if we think about the uh deterministic code, right?

**[09:12]** about the uh deterministic code, right?

**[09:12]** about the uh deterministic code, right? I withdraw $100 from the ATM. My bank

**[09:14]** I withdraw $100 from the ATM. My bank

**[09:14]** I withdraw $100 from the ATM. My bank account should have $100 less, right?

**[09:17]** account should have $100 less, right?

**[09:17]** account should have $100 less, right? Great. And I can test that. And I can

**[09:19]** Great. And I can test that. And I can

**[09:19]** Great. And I can test that. And I can write code to test that. When the test

**[09:20]** write code to test that. When the test

**[09:20]** write code to test that. When the test is like, was she snarky in Slack? It's

**[09:24]** is like, was she snarky in Slack? It's

**[09:24]** is like, was she snarky in Slack? It's like, well, how do you test that? How do

**[09:25]** like, well, how do you test that? How do

**[09:25]** like, well, how do you test that? How do you write that test? Right? So, we come

**[09:27]** you write that test? Right? So, we come

**[09:27]** you write that test? Right? So, we come up with this this whole new discipline

**[09:28]** up with this this whole new discipline

**[09:28]** up with this this whole new discipline of evals, which is, well,

**[09:32]** of evals, which is, well,

**[09:32]** of evals, which is, well, she should be a little bit snarky and a

**[09:34]** she should be a little bit snarky and a

**[09:34]** she should be a little bit snarky and a little bit funny, but not mean. And then

**[09:35]** little bit funny, but not mean. And then

**[09:35]** little bit funny, but not mean. And then we hand it off to another LLM to say

**[09:37]** we hand it off to another LLM to say

**[09:38]** we hand it off to another LLM to say okay well hey was that reply like did it

**[09:40]** okay well hey was that reply like did it

**[09:40]** okay well hey was that reply like did it meet that criteria and how often did it

**[09:43]** meet that criteria and how often did it

**[09:43]** meet that criteria and how often did it um it doesn't have to be 100%. Right? So

**[09:46]** um it doesn't have to be 100%. Right? So

**[09:46]** um it doesn't have to be 100%. Right? So she should be like pretty snarky but

**[09:49]** she should be like pretty snarky but

**[09:49]** she should be like pretty snarky but like not mean 80% of the time or

**[09:51]** like not mean 80% of the time or

**[09:51]** like not mean 80% of the time or whatever the uh uh business logic that

**[09:53]** whatever the uh uh business logic that

**[09:53]** whatever the uh uh business logic that you want. Right? So these are eval

**[09:56]** you want. Right? So these are eval

**[09:56]** you want. Right? So these are eval but here's what I would posit which is

**[09:58]** but here's what I would posit which is

**[09:58]** but here's what I would posit which is it is the only way that we know what our


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:01]** it is the only way that we know what our

**[10:01]** it is the only way that we know what our software can do

**[10:03]** software can do

**[10:03]** software can do right and which is why I love the idea

**[10:05]** right and which is why I love the idea

**[10:05]** right and which is why I love the idea of product people looking at the eval

**[10:07]** of product people looking at the eval

**[10:07]** of product people looking at the eval right looking at uh because they become

**[10:09]** right looking at uh because they become

**[10:10]** right looking at uh because they become the new specification for the product

**[10:12]** the new specification for the product

**[10:12]** the new specification for the product right and so as we're watching you know

**[10:14]** right and so as we're watching you know

**[10:14]** right and so as we're watching you know if you're downstairs in the expo gallery

**[10:15]** if you're downstairs in the expo gallery

**[10:15]** if you're downstairs in the expo gallery you're seeing like new software it's

**[10:16]** you're seeing like new software it's

**[10:16]** you're seeing like new software it's like hey bring the team in and this a

**[10:18]** like hey bring the team in and this a

**[10:18]** like hey bring the team in and this a little bit reminds me of like the old

**[10:19]** little bit reminds me of like the old

**[10:19]** little bit reminds me of like the old you know for the the old-timers here

**[10:21]** you know for the the old-timers here

**[10:21]** you know for the the old-timers here like behavior driven development there

**[10:23]** like behavior driven development there

**[10:23]** like behavior driven development there was this period of time when I was Oh,

**[10:24]** was this period of time when I was Oh,

**[10:24]** was this period of time when I was Oh, the business people are going to write

**[10:25]** the business people are going to write

**[10:25]** the business people are going to write the tests and that will get converted to

**[10:26]** the tests and that will get converted to

**[10:26]** the tests and that will get converted to code and then the code will run and like

**[10:29]** code and then the code will run and like

**[10:29]** code and then the code will run and like the truth is like no one ever wanted to

**[10:30]** the truth is like no one ever wanted to

**[10:30]** the truth is like no one ever wanted to do that. Like no business per I don't

**[10:31]** do that. Like no business per I don't

**[10:32]** do that. Like no business per I don't even know who a business person is but

**[10:33]** even know who a business person is but

**[10:33]** even know who a business person is but like they want we're going to do that.

**[10:35]** like they want we're going to do that.

**[10:35]** like they want we're going to do that. But I actually think this is different

**[10:36]** But I actually think this is different

**[10:36]** But I actually think this is different and I think this is pretty um a

**[10:38]** and I think this is pretty um a

**[10:38]** and I think this is pretty um a meaningful way to actually understand

**[10:40]** meaningful way to actually understand

**[10:40]** meaningful way to actually understand what the product can do and a little bit

**[10:43]** what the product can do and a little bit

**[10:43]** what the product can do and a little bit begin to specify what it can do.

**[10:46]** begin to specify what it can do.

**[10:46]** begin to specify what it can do. Okay. So vibe coding for a second which

**[10:49]** Okay. So vibe coding for a second which

**[10:49]** Okay. So vibe coding for a second which we which we all do we all talk about. I

**[10:51]** we which we all do we all talk about. I

**[10:51]** we which we all do we all talk about. I want to talk about vibe coding in a in a

**[10:52]** want to talk about vibe coding in a in a

**[10:52]** want to talk about vibe coding in a in a way that's really constructive

**[10:55]** way that's really constructive

**[10:55]** way that's really constructive and

**[10:56]** and

**[10:56]** and how do I sort of say this? It's very

**[10:59]** how do I sort of say this? It's very

**[10:59]** how do I sort of say this? It's very very hard. I think I I kind of was like


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** very hard. I think I I kind of was like

**[11:00]** very hard. I think I I kind of was like like oh you can't do it in Figma. You

**[11:02]** like oh you can't do it in Figma. You

**[11:02]** like oh you can't do it in Figma. You can't do it in a PRD. Like what do I

**[11:03]** can't do it in a PRD. Like what do I

**[11:03]** can't do it in a PRD. Like what do I really mean? Well, it's very hard to

**[11:05]** really mean? Well, it's very hard to

**[11:05]** really mean? Well, it's very hard to like sit down in front of a blank piece

**[11:07]** like sit down in front of a blank piece

**[11:07]** like sit down in front of a blank piece of paper and um write what the teammate

**[11:11]** of paper and um write what the teammate

**[11:11]** of paper and um write what the teammate the agent experience should be. It's

**[11:14]** the agent experience should be. It's

**[11:14]** the agent experience should be. It's just really hard. It's hard to like

**[11:16]** just really hard. It's hard to like

**[11:16]** just really hard. It's hard to like imagine it. And it's not until you feel

**[11:18]** imagine it. And it's not until you feel

**[11:18]** imagine it. And it's not until you feel it. I mean, so much of what we're doing

**[11:19]** it. I mean, so much of what we're doing

**[11:19]** it. I mean, so much of what we're doing in this like human computer interface is

**[11:21]** in this like human computer interface is

**[11:21]** in this like human computer interface is visceral. It's feel. It is like, oh,

**[11:24]** visceral. It's feel. It is like, oh,

**[11:24]** visceral. It's feel. It is like, oh, well, like, did they ask too many

**[11:26]** well, like, did they ask too many

**[11:26]** well, like, did they ask too many questions? Like, how many questions is

**[11:27]** questions? Like, how many questions is

**[11:27]** questions? Like, how many questions is too many? Oh, wouldn't it be great if

**[11:29]** too many? Oh, wouldn't it be great if

**[11:29]** too many? Oh, wouldn't it be great if they clarified exactly what you meant?

**[11:31]** they clarified exactly what you meant?

**[11:31]** they clarified exactly what you meant? Well, turns out that's really annoying.

**[11:33]** Well, turns out that's really annoying.

**[11:33]** Well, turns out that's really annoying. But when I wrote like the first spec,

**[11:34]** But when I wrote like the first spec,

**[11:34]** But when I wrote like the first spec, I'm like, then the teammate should ask a

**[11:36]** I'm like, then the teammate should ask a

**[11:36]** I'm like, then the teammate should ask a lot of clarifying questions. And we gave

**[11:37]** lot of clarifying questions. And we gave

**[11:37]** lot of clarifying questions. And we gave it to users and they were like, "This

**[11:39]** it to users and they were like, "This

**[11:39]** it to users and they were like, "This sucks." And I was like, "How would I

**[11:40]** sucks." And I was like, "How would I

**[11:40]** sucks." And I was like, "How would I have ever known that?" And the answer is

**[11:42]** have ever known that?" And the answer is

**[11:42]** have ever known that?" And the answer is because it's so easy to prototype and

**[11:45]** because it's so easy to prototype and

**[11:45]** because it's so easy to prototype and vibe code something and get the feels.

**[11:47]** vibe code something and get the feels.

**[11:47]** vibe code something and get the feels. And so this is the next thing that I'm

**[11:49]** And so this is the next thing that I'm

**[11:49]** And so this is the next thing that I'm like pretty excited about as a new

**[11:51]** like pretty excited about as a new

**[11:51]** like pretty excited about as a new product management tool. It is being

**[11:53]** product management tool. It is being

**[11:53]** product management tool. It is being able to feel and experience um what it's

**[11:57]** able to feel and experience um what it's

**[11:57]** able to feel and experience um what it's like to interact with a computer but uh


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:01]** like to interact with a computer but uh

**[12:01]** like to interact with a computer but uh uh without just like uh writing it or

**[12:03]** uh without just like uh writing it or

**[12:03]** uh without just like uh writing it or hoping that you have a clickable

**[12:04]** hoping that you have a clickable

**[12:04]** hoping that you have a clickable prototype that will work. I will also

**[12:06]** prototype that will work. I will also

**[12:06]** prototype that will work. I will also mention that we have to be careful with

**[12:08]** mention that we have to be careful with

**[12:08]** mention that we have to be careful with vibe coding because I do not mean sit in

**[12:10]** vibe coding because I do not mean sit in

**[12:10]** vibe coding because I do not mean sit in the meeting and say to the engineering

**[12:11]** the meeting and say to the engineering

**[12:12]** the meeting and say to the engineering team how come this is taking two weeks I

**[12:14]** team how come this is taking two weeks I

**[12:14]** team how come this is taking two weeks I finished the feature during the meeting

**[12:16]** finished the feature during the meeting

**[12:16]** finished the feature during the meeting like that doesn't

**[12:18]** like that doesn't

**[12:18]** like that doesn't that doesn't win you any points right so

**[12:20]** that doesn't win you any points right so

**[12:20]** that doesn't win you any points right so it is no no this is never going to

**[12:22]** it is no no this is never going to

**[12:22]** it is no no this is never going to production but what this does is it

**[12:24]** production but what this does is it

**[12:24]** production but what this does is it gives you the feel the the experience

**[12:27]** gives you the feel the the experience

**[12:27]** gives you the feel the the experience right and so this is like the only way I

**[12:29]** right and so this is like the only way I

**[12:29]** right and so this is like the only way I know to like actually test and feel it

**[12:31]** know to like actually test and feel it

**[12:31]** know to like actually test and feel it out

**[12:32]** out

**[12:32]** out do um do you remember like the the

**[12:34]** do um do you remember like the the

**[12:34]** do um do you remember like the the clawed um certainty issue certainly. I

**[12:36]** clawed um certainty issue certainly. I

**[12:36]** clawed um certainty issue certainly. I mean certainly there was this per right

**[12:38]** mean certainly there was this per right

**[12:38]** mean certainly there was this per right when every time you ask clause like

**[12:39]** when every time you ask clause like

**[12:39]** when every time you ask clause like certainly and like that probably like

**[12:41]** certainly and like that probably like

**[12:41]** certainly and like that probably like seemed really good when you're testing

**[12:42]** seemed really good when you're testing

**[12:42]** seemed really good when you're testing it for the very first time and then like

**[12:43]** it for the very first time and then like

**[12:44]** it for the very first time and then like the fourth time when you're like hey can

**[12:45]** the fourth time when you're like hey can

**[12:45]** the fourth time when you're like hey can you do my tax he's like certainly can

**[12:47]** you do my tax he's like certainly can

**[12:47]** you do my tax he's like certainly can you write my like acceptance speech

**[12:49]** you write my like acceptance speech

**[12:49]** you write my like acceptance speech certainly like oh this is actually

**[12:50]** certainly like oh this is actually

**[12:50]** certainly like oh this is actually really annoying but you don't realize

**[12:52]** really annoying but you don't realize

**[12:52]** really annoying but you don't realize that until you experience it. So like

**[12:54]** that until you experience it. So like

**[12:54]** that until you experience it. So like that's why I like the vibe coding.

**[12:57]** that's why I like the vibe coding.

**[12:57]** that's why I like the vibe coding. Okay so great we did all this

**[12:59]** Okay so great we did all this

**[12:59]** Okay so great we did all this development and then the question is


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** development and then the question is

**[13:00]** development and then the question is like hey we pushed a prod does it work?

**[13:02]** like hey we pushed a prod does it work?

**[13:02]** like hey we pushed a prod does it work? I'm like, I told you I don't know. So,

**[13:05]** I'm like, I told you I don't know. So,

**[13:05]** I'm like, I told you I don't know. So, the question is like, how do you test?

**[13:06]** the question is like, how do you test?

**[13:06]** the question is like, how do you test? How do you like know that it's going to

**[13:07]** How do you like know that it's going to

**[13:08]** How do you like know that it's going to do uh the things that you said it was

**[13:10]** do uh the things that you said it was

**[13:10]** do uh the things that you said it was going to do? And I sort of alluded to

**[13:11]** going to do? And I sort of alluded to

**[13:53]** like these just like crazy ideas, but this is where like the emerging behavior

**[13:55]** this is where like the emerging behavior

**[13:55]** this is where like the emerging behavior comes from, right?" And so, it's this

**[13:57]** comes from, right?" And so, it's this

**[13:57]** comes from, right?" And so, it's this mindset of like let's just try, let's

**[13:59]** mindset of like let's just try, let's

**[13:59]** mindset of like let's just try, let's just experiment. And it's it's this like


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** just experiment. And it's it's this like

**[14:01]** just experiment. And it's it's this like kind of growth mindset shift from like

**[14:03]** kind of growth mindset shift from like

**[14:04]** kind of growth mindset shift from like I'm going to write the features and the

**[14:06]** I'm going to write the features and the

**[14:06]** I'm going to write the features and the requirements to no we're going to figure

**[14:08]** requirements to no we're going to figure

**[14:08]** requirements to no we're going to figure it out.

**[14:13]** This was a little bit unexpected for me

**[14:14]** This was a little bit unexpected for me and this is um how do you sort of report

**[14:19]** and this is um how do you sort of report

**[14:19]** and this is um how do you sort of report to engineering and then have things

**[14:21]** to engineering and then have things

**[14:21]** to engineering and then have things fixed by engineering and what counts as

**[14:23]** fixed by engineering and what counts as

**[14:23]** fixed by engineering and what counts as a bug in this world and that is really

**[14:26]** a bug in this world and that is really

**[14:26]** a bug in this world and that is really really strange and I think as sort of I

**[14:28]** really strange and I think as sort of I

**[14:28]** really strange and I think as sort of I don't know if it's like just a product

**[14:30]** don't know if it's like just a product

**[14:30]** don't know if it's like just a product role or maybe in a support role like how

**[14:31]** role or maybe in a support role like how

**[14:31]** role or maybe in a support role like how do you know what is appropriate to

**[14:33]** do you know what is appropriate to

**[14:33]** do you know what is appropriate to escalate to put onto the backlog to flag

**[14:36]** escalate to put onto the backlog to flag

**[14:36]** escalate to put onto the backlog to flag as a bug right it's like I'll keep

**[14:38]** as a bug right it's like I'll keep

**[14:38]** as a bug right it's like I'll keep picking on on Stacy you know she she

**[14:40]** picking on on Stacy you know she she

**[14:40]** picking on on Stacy you know she she gives me a really hard time so it's fine

**[14:41]** gives me a really hard time so it's fine

**[14:41]** gives me a really hard time so it's fine Uh, it's like, "Hey, she used too many

**[14:43]** Uh, it's like, "Hey, she used too many

**[14:43]** Uh, it's like, "Hey, she used too many emojis. Like, put it in in in linear."

**[14:46]** emojis. Like, put it in in in linear."

**[14:46]** emojis. Like, put it in in in linear." It's like, well, it's not really a bug.

**[14:48]** It's like, well, it's not really a bug.

**[14:48]** It's like, well, it's not really a bug. Like, show me in the spec where you told

**[14:50]** Like, show me in the spec where you told

**[14:50]** Like, show me in the spec where you told me not to use too many emojis, right?

**[14:51]** me not to use too many emojis, right?

**[14:51]** me not to use too many emojis, right? So, it's it's almost like um like in our

**[14:54]** So, it's it's almost like um like in our

**[14:54]** So, it's it's almost like um like in our tickets, it's like, oh, you know,

**[14:56]** tickets, it's like, oh, you know,

**[14:56]** tickets, it's like, oh, you know, closed, done, closed, duplicate. We need

**[14:58]** closed, done, closed, duplicate. We need

**[14:58]** closed, done, closed, duplicate. We need like closed LLMs be like crazy, yo, like


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:02]** like closed LLMs be like crazy, yo, like

**[15:02]** like closed LLMs be like crazy, yo, like I don't know how to fix this like just

**[15:03]** I don't know how to fix this like just

**[15:03]** I don't know how to fix this like just because it's probabilistically

**[15:04]** because it's probabilistically

**[15:04]** because it's probabilistically generated. So, how do we know if it's

**[15:06]** generated. So, how do we know if it's

**[15:06]** generated. So, how do we know if it's right or wrong? How do you know if it's

**[15:07]** right or wrong? How do you know if it's

**[15:07]** right or wrong? How do you know if it's a feature, if it's a bug, right? Right.

**[15:09]** a feature, if it's a bug, right? Right.

**[15:09]** a feature, if it's a bug, right? Right. And I think there's this element of um

**[15:11]** And I think there's this element of um

**[15:11]** And I think there's this element of um credibility that we need to build up.

**[15:12]** credibility that we need to build up.

**[15:12]** credibility that we need to build up. It's like, hey, we actually under we

**[15:15]** It's like, hey, we actually under we

**[15:15]** It's like, hey, we actually under we understand that for some use cases like

**[15:18]** understand that for some use cases like

**[15:18]** understand that for some use cases like 80% is good enough, right? This eval

**[15:22]** 80% is good enough, right? This eval

**[15:22]** 80% is good enough, right? This eval if it's passing 90% of the time like

**[15:24]** if it's passing 90% of the time like

**[15:24]** if it's passing 90% of the time like that's a go. If it falls below 90%,

**[15:26]** that's a go. If it falls below 90%,

**[15:26]** that's a go. If it falls below 90%, right? That's red and we're not going to

**[15:27]** right? That's red and we're not going to

**[15:27]** right? That's red and we're not going to ship it. So actually come back to evals

**[15:30]** ship it. So actually come back to evals

**[15:30]** ship it. So actually come back to evals for a second because if the eval becomes

**[15:32]** for a second because if the eval becomes

**[15:32]** for a second because if the eval becomes the spec and we can say hey we said at

**[15:35]** the spec and we can say hey we said at

**[15:35]** the spec and we can say hey we said at you know 100% even though this is

**[15:37]** you know 100% even though this is

**[15:37]** you know 100% even though this is probability you should never give a

**[15:39]** probability you should never give a

**[15:39]** probability you should never give a refund if a customer like can't prove

**[15:41]** refund if a customer like can't prove

**[15:41]** refund if a customer like can't prove that they bought the thing or whatever

**[15:42]** that they bought the thing or whatever

**[15:42]** that they bought the thing or whatever like it is it's like great that is our

**[15:44]** like it is it's like great that is our

**[15:44]** like it is it's like great that is our metric and we could say yeah this is a

**[15:45]** metric and we could say yeah this is a

**[15:46]** metric and we could say yeah this is a bug but if it's just a a feel becomes

**[15:48]** bug but if it's just a a feel becomes

**[15:48]** bug but if it's just a a feel becomes really difficult again this was totally

**[15:50]** really difficult again this was totally

**[15:50]** really difficult again this was totally unexpected that like uh debugging and

**[15:53]** unexpected that like uh debugging and

**[15:53]** unexpected that like uh debugging and assigning bugs would become like uh

**[15:56]** assigning bugs would become like uh

**[15:56]** assigning bugs would become like uh controversial.

**[15:57]** controversial.

**[15:58]** controversial. Okay, customers. So, this part is


### [16:00 - 17:00]
