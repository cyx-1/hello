## Executive Summary

Swyx delivers a rallying keynote at the AI Engineer Code Summit declaring war on "slop" - low-quality, inauthentic, or inaccurate content and code, whether produced by humans or AI. He argues that while AI makes content creation exponentially cheaper, fighting slop requires an order of magnitude more taste and effort than creating it. The talk emphasizes that slop isn't exclusive to AI-generated content; humans produce it too. Swyx introduces "Ficks's law of anti-slop" and advocates for using AI itself to combat slop through better curation, code review tools, computer use automation, and modular design principles. The talk concludes with a participatory chant: "No more slop!"

## Topics

### [Introduction and AI Engineer Summit Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=23s)
**[00:23 - 01:00]**

- Swyx shares the "secret" evolution of AI Engineer Summits
- First summit: validated AI engineers as a profession
- Second summit: expanded to leadership
- Third summit: focused on model labs (bringing all top-tier labs)
- World's Fair: expanded TAM to include AI PMs and designers
- Code Summit: focused on curation and the coding theme

**Key Points:**
- Each summit iteration had a strategic focus
- Code Summit represents deep focus on quality over quantity
- Declares war on "slop" as the central theme

### [Defining Slop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=85s)
**[01:25 - 03:00]**

- Oxford Dictionary candidate for 2024 word of the year (lost to "brain rot")
- Definition: "low-quality, inauthentic or inaccurate" content
- Swyx disagrees with Oxford's AI-exclusive framing
- The opposite of slop is "kino" (high-quality, authentic content)

**Key Points:**
- Slop is NOT exclusive to AI - humans produce it too
- Quality vs quantity tension exists everywhere
- Examples span media (Netflix shows), AI models, memes, and startup ideas

### [Examples of Slop vs Kino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=179s)
**[02:59 - 04:00]**

- Sora videos: boring (slop) vs creative cat videos (kino)
- Netflix: "Electric State" (slop) vs "K-pop Demon Hunters" (kino)
- AI models: comparison left to audience interpretation
- Viral memes: fresh and new (kino) can degenerate into overused (slop)
- Game of Thrones: early seasons (kino) vs final seasons (slop)
- Startup ideas: same concept executed differently

**Key Points:**
- Same creator/studio can produce both slop and kino
- Timing matters - early trends are kino, overused trends become slop
- Execution and taste determine quality

### [The Asymmetric War Against Slop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=270s)
**[04:30 - 05:00]**

- Introduces Brandolini's Law: "The amount of energy needed to refute BS is an order of magnitude bigger than needed to produce it"
- Proposes "Ficks's Law of Anti-Slop": "The amount of taste needed to fight slop is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it"
- Cost of generating tokens dropping 100-1000x per year
- Low taste content proliferating rapidly

**Key Points:**
- Fighting slop is inherently harder than producing it
- AI accelerates slop production exponentially
- Requires elevated taste and curation standards

### [Using AI to Fight Slop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=300s)
**[05:00 - 06:00]**

- AI News newsletter: tells readers NOT to read when nothing important happened
- Anthropic prompts acknowledge slop and instruct Claude not to produce it
- Results improve significantly when anti-slop instructions are included
- Positive message: AI can be weaponized against slop

**Key Points:**
- Curation over constant content
- Explicit anti-slop prompting improves output quality
- AI as a tool for quality control, not just generation

### [Code Slop and Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=344s)
**[05:44 - 07:00]**

- Code slop examples:
  - "Two engineers can create tech debt of 50 engineers"
  - Private data exposure incidents (all happened in 2024)
  - Autonomy without accountability: claiming "30-60 hours autonomous" without code quality metrics
- Principle: "No taxation without representation = No autonomy without accountability"

**Solutions presented:**
- Semi-sync value of depth: human attention on hard problems, async for commodity tasks
- Code maps: using AI to scale codebase understanding (Cognition's approach)
- Computer use: AI autonomously operating complex apps including IDEs
- Devon example: automating website updates

**Key Points:**
- Speed without quality creates technical debt
- Metrics must include quality, not just velocity
- AI tools should enhance understanding and accountability

### [Sub-Agents and Modularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=416s)
**[06:56 - 08:00]**

- Using sub-agents to fight "context rot" (learned from conference)
- Greg Brockman's modularity concept: clear boundaries between human design and AI implementation
- Keep human-designed interfaces clear, let AI code "everything in between"

**Key Points:**
- Sub-agents prevent context degradation in long workflows
- Modularity preserves human intent while leveraging AI capabilities
- Emerged as major theme of the Code Summit

### [The Call to Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiHI7p12Ao&t=485s)
**[08:05 - 08:57]**

- Swyx leads audience in participatory chant: "No more slop!"
- Scenarios presented:
  - Boss demands more lines of code by quarter end → "No more slop!"
  - Pressure to ship insufficiently tested release → "No more slop!"
  - Twitter algorithm pushes engagement bait/lies → "No more slop!"

**Key Points:**
- Stand firm on quality standards
- Resist pressure for quantity over quality
- Cultural change requires collective action
- Engineers must advocate for quality

## Key Takeaways

1. **Slop is universal**: Not limited to AI - humans produce just as much low-quality content
2. **Asymmetric warfare**: Fighting slop requires far more effort than creating it
3. **AI as solution**: Use AI tools to combat slop through better prompting, code review, and automation
4. **Accountability matters**: Autonomy without quality metrics is dangerous
5. **Modularity wins**: Clear human-AI boundaries prevent slop proliferation
6. **Cultural stance**: "No more slop" as a professional principle
