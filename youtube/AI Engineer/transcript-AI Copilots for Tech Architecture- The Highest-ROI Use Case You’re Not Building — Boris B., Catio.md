**[00:02]** Hi, I'm Boris Bogatin, CEO and

**[00:02]** Hi, I'm Boris Bogatin, CEO and co-founder of Kato.io.

**[00:04]** co-founder of Kato.io.

**[00:04]** co-founder of Kato.io. >> Hi, I'm Tufi Pubz. I'm CTO and

**[00:05]** >> Hi, I'm Tufi Pubz. I'm CTO and

**[00:06]** >> Hi, I'm Tufi Pubz. I'm CTO and co-founder also at CADO.

**[00:07]** co-founder also at CADO.

**[00:07]** co-founder also at CADO. >> Today we're here to talk about AI

**[00:09]** >> Today we're here to talk about AI

**[00:09]** >> Today we're here to talk about AI co-pilots for tech architecture, the

**[00:11]** co-pilots for tech architecture, the

**[00:11]** co-pilots for tech architecture, the highest ROI capability you're not yet

**[00:13]** highest ROI capability you're not yet

**[00:13]** highest ROI capability you're not yet using. A topic that's been near and dear

**[00:16]** using. A topic that's been near and dear

**[00:16]** using. A topic that's been near and dear to our heart. Over the last two years, I

**[00:19]** to our heart. Over the last two years, I

**[00:19]** to our heart. Over the last two years, I would say coding co-pilots have become

**[00:21]** would say coding co-pilots have become

**[00:21]** would say coding co-pilots have become truly table stakes. You know, it's

**[00:23]** truly table stakes. You know, it's

**[00:23]** truly table stakes. You know, it's interesting because, you know, you take

**[00:25]** interesting because, you know, you take

**[00:25]** interesting because, you know, you take it back three, four years ago. I know

**[00:27]** it back three, four years ago. I know

**[00:27]** it back three, four years ago. I know Tufik and I talk about this a lot. to

**[00:29]** Tufik and I talk about this a lot. to

**[00:29]** Tufik and I talk about this a lot. to his days back when he was the VP at

**[00:31]** his days back when he was the VP at

**[00:31]** his days back when he was the VP at Splunk a lot of the you know hot shot

**[00:33]** Splunk a lot of the you know hot shot

**[00:33]** Splunk a lot of the you know hot shot developers would always talk about how

**[00:35]** developers would always talk about how

**[00:35]** developers would always talk about how you know coding co-pilots would never be

**[00:37]** you know coding co-pilots would never be

**[00:37]** you know coding co-pilots would never be able to kind of supplement them

**[00:38]** able to kind of supplement them

**[00:38]** able to kind of supplement them >> right to

**[00:39]** >> right to

**[00:39]** >> right to >> yeah it would never work yeah

**[00:41]** >> yeah it would never work yeah

**[00:41]** >> yeah it would never work yeah >> never work right because how could you

**[00:43]** >> never work right because how could you

**[00:44]** >> never work right because how could you and now coding co-pilots are helping us

**[00:46]** and now coding co-pilots are helping us

**[00:46]** and now coding co-pilots are helping us tremendously multiply productivity

**[00:48]** tremendously multiply productivity

**[00:48]** tremendously multiply productivity output and you know if we look at the

**[00:50]** output and you know if we look at the

**[00:50]** output and you know if we look at the whole cycle as you can see on the slide

**[00:52]** whole cycle as you can see on the slide

**[00:52]** whole cycle as you can see on the slide here you know the full life cycle of

**[00:54]** here you know the full life cycle of

**[00:54]** here you know the full life cycle of software development has been so well

**[00:56]** software development has been so well

**[00:56]** software development has been so well you know uh situated and and and served

**[00:58]** you know uh situated and and and served

**[00:58]** you know uh situated and and and served with tooling from software project


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** with tooling from software project

**[01:01]** with tooling from software project management to execution to operations

**[01:04]** management to execution to operations

**[01:04]** management to execution to operations Splunk and Data Dog. Today the software

**[01:06]** Splunk and Data Dog. Today the software

**[01:06]** Splunk and Data Dog. Today the software life cycle self-development life cycle

**[01:07]** life cycle self-development life cycle

**[01:07]** life cycle self-development life cycle is filled with tooling coding co-pilots

**[01:09]** is filled with tooling coding co-pilots

**[01:09]** is filled with tooling coding co-pilots multiplying the productivity and we're

**[01:11]** multiplying the productivity and we're

**[01:11]** multiplying the productivity and we're excited about that which we should be.

**[01:13]** excited about that which we should be.

**[01:13]** excited about that which we should be. But when you step back you step back and

**[01:15]** But when you step back you step back and

**[01:15]** But when you step back you step back and you ask the question you know is there

**[01:19]** you ask the question you know is there

**[01:19]** you ask the question you know is there something missing and something yet not

**[01:21]** something missing and something yet not

**[01:21]** something missing and something yet not addressed? Because isn't the highest

**[01:23]** addressed? Because isn't the highest

**[01:23]** addressed? Because isn't the highest leverage co-pilot the one that we're

**[01:25]** leverage co-pilot the one that we're

**[01:25]** leverage co-pilot the one that we're really not using yet the architecture

**[01:27]** really not using yet the architecture

**[01:27]** really not using yet the architecture co-pilot? Why architecture? At the end

**[01:30]** co-pilot? Why architecture? At the end

**[01:30]** co-pilot? Why architecture? At the end of the day, architecture is where ROI is

**[01:32]** of the day, architecture is where ROI is

**[01:32]** of the day, architecture is where ROI is one or lowest. If you're going into the

**[01:34]** one or lowest. If you're going into the

**[01:34]** one or lowest. If you're going into the wrong direction with a lot of coding

**[01:36]** wrong direction with a lot of coding

**[01:36]** wrong direction with a lot of coding output, are you not going to get to poor

**[01:39]** output, are you not going to get to poor

**[01:39]** output, are you not going to get to poor code, poor results, and a lot of redo

**[01:42]** code, poor results, and a lot of redo

**[01:42]** code, poor results, and a lot of redo and tech debt versus moving truly into

**[01:45]** and tech debt versus moving truly into

**[01:45]** and tech debt versus moving truly into the right architectural direction?

**[01:48]** the right architectural direction?

**[01:48]** the right architectural direction? To us, architecture decisions is what

**[01:51]** To us, architecture decisions is what

**[01:51]** To us, architecture decisions is what drives things like nine figure spends um

**[01:55]** drives things like nine figure spends um

**[01:55]** drives things like nine figure spends um through business objectives and and and

**[01:57]** through business objectives and and and

**[01:57]** through business objectives and and and how tech fuels them instead of slowing

**[01:59]** how tech fuels them instead of slowing

**[01:59]** how tech fuels them instead of slowing them down. How you can stay ahead and


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:02]** them down. How you can stay ahead and

**[02:02]** them down. How you can stay ahead and bestin-class versus drown in tech debt

**[02:05]** bestin-class versus drown in tech debt

**[02:05]** bestin-class versus drown in tech debt and always playing catch-up. That's

**[02:06]** and always playing catch-up. That's

**[02:06]** and always playing catch-up. That's really at the heart of you know why

**[02:08]** really at the heart of you know why

**[02:08]** really at the heart of you know why we've come together here um around this

**[02:11]** we've come together here um around this

**[02:28]** and increasingly delegated in shift flat

**[02:28]** and increasingly delegated in shift flat fashion to developers and it's fantastic

**[02:30]** fashion to developers and it's fantastic

**[02:30]** fashion to developers and it's fantastic to see that the whole organic process we

**[02:32]** to see that the whole organic process we

**[02:32]** to see that the whole organic process we love it but we we we've always thought

**[02:34]** love it but we we we've always thought

**[02:34]** love it but we we we've always thought there's got to be a better way and

**[02:36]** there's got to be a better way and

**[02:36]** there's got to be a better way and especially in a day of AI there's got to

**[02:38]** especially in a day of AI there's got to

**[02:38]** especially in a day of AI there's got to be a better way so today we want to walk

**[02:40]** be a better way so today we want to walk

**[02:40]** be a better way so today we want to walk through the three critical challenges

**[02:41]** through the three critical challenges

**[02:41]** through the three critical challenges that are keeping leaders up at night

**[02:43]** that are keeping leaders up at night

**[02:43]** that are keeping leaders up at night that we hear day in and day out and how

**[02:45]** that we hear day in and day out and how

**[02:45]** that we hear day in and day out and how they're being solved and what that

**[02:47]** they're being solved and what that

**[02:47]** they're being solved and what that future looks like in closed door CTO

**[02:49]** future looks like in closed door CTO

**[02:49]** future looks like in closed door CTO dinners and you know our work with

**[02:51]** dinners and you know our work with

**[02:51]** dinners and you know our work with enterprises and growth stage companies

**[02:53]** enterprises and growth stage companies

**[02:53]** enterprises and growth stage companies the like we keep hearing the same pain

**[02:54]** the like we keep hearing the same pain

**[02:54]** the like we keep hearing the same pain points I know you've been in the weeds

**[02:57]** points I know you've been in the weeds

**[02:57]** points I know you've been in the weeds on this what are the top three things

**[02:58]** on this what are the top three things

**[02:58]** on this what are the top three things you keep hearing from architecture


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** you keep hearing from architecture

**[03:00]** you keep hearing from architecture leaders

**[03:01]** leaders

**[03:01]** leaders >> yeah that are keeping him up at night

**[03:02]** >> yeah that are keeping him up at night

**[03:02]** >> yeah that are keeping him up at night >> oh great so so based on a lot of

**[03:04]** >> oh great so so based on a lot of

**[03:04]** >> oh great so so based on a lot of conversations we've had and actually on

**[03:06]** conversations we've had and actually on

**[03:06]** conversations we've had and actually on my own experiences as an architect and a

**[03:08]** my own experiences as an architect and a

**[03:08]** my own experiences as an architect and a CTO long-term CTO in in many companies

**[03:11]** CTO long-term CTO in in many companies

**[03:11]** CTO long-term CTO in in many companies there's at least three big challenges

**[03:14]** there's at least three big challenges

**[03:14]** there's at least three big challenges that we typically encounter counter. Um,

**[03:17]** that we typically encounter counter. Um,

**[03:17]** that we typically encounter counter. Um, the first one is visibility. So, as your

**[03:20]** the first one is visibility. So, as your

**[03:20]** the first one is visibility. So, as your tech estate grows, you start to fly

**[03:23]** tech estate grows, you start to fly

**[03:23]** tech estate grows, you start to fly blind across your landscape. Excuse the

**[03:26]** blind across your landscape. Excuse the

**[03:26]** blind across your landscape. Excuse the mixed metaphor here. I like these

**[03:27]** mixed metaphor here. I like these

**[03:27]** mixed metaphor here. I like these metaphors, but you know, you start

**[03:29]** metaphors, but you know, you start

**[03:29]** metaphors, but you know, you start flying blind across that landscape and

**[03:31]** flying blind across that landscape and

**[03:31]** flying blind across that landscape and and it's really hard to kind of gauge

**[03:33]** and it's really hard to kind of gauge

**[03:33]** and it's really hard to kind of gauge where you are or or or to make real

**[03:36]** where you are or or or to make real

**[03:36]** where you are or or or to make real plans. So, that lack of visibility is

**[03:38]** plans. So, that lack of visibility is

**[03:38]** plans. So, that lack of visibility is one of the biggest issues. The other one

**[03:40]** one of the biggest issues. The other one

**[03:40]** one of the biggest issues. The other one is having ROI tied and databbacked path

**[03:44]** is having ROI tied and databbacked path

**[03:44]** is having ROI tied and databbacked path forward. you know, knowing where to

**[03:46]** forward. you know, knowing where to

**[03:46]** forward. you know, knowing where to focus, what to prioritize, and how to

**[03:49]** focus, what to prioritize, and how to

**[03:49]** focus, what to prioritize, and how to defend your decisions in a way that can

**[03:51]** defend your decisions in a way that can

**[03:51]** defend your decisions in a way that can be backed up by data is really it's

**[03:53]** be backed up by data is really it's

**[03:53]** be backed up by data is really it's always been a challenge. I mean, I I sit

**[03:55]** always been a challenge. I mean, I I sit

**[03:55]** always been a challenge. I mean, I I sit on boards or with other executives, you

**[03:57]** on boards or with other executives, you

**[03:57]** on boards or with other executives, you know, at startups and at big companies

**[03:59]** know, at startups and at big companies

**[03:59]** know, at startups and at big companies and the question is always well, you


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** and the question is always well, you

**[04:01]** and the question is always well, you know, I ask for things or I'm ask for

**[04:03]** know, I ask for things or I'm ask for

**[04:04]** know, I ask for things or I'm ask for stuff and it's hard to always to to have

**[04:06]** stuff and it's hard to always to to have

**[04:06]** stuff and it's hard to always to to have a good answer that is data back, right?

**[04:08]** a good answer that is data back, right?

**[04:08]** a good answer that is data back, right? So, so how do you do that and especially

**[04:10]** So, so how do you do that and especially

**[04:10]** So, so how do you do that and especially that is tied to ROI because at the end

**[04:12]** that is tied to ROI because at the end

**[04:12]** that is tied to ROI because at the end of the day you know how do we spend how

**[04:14]** of the day you know how do we spend how

**[04:14]** of the day you know how do we spend how do we manage our spend. The third one

**[04:16]** do we manage our spend. The third one

**[04:16]** do we manage our spend. The third one though is some form of autonomous

**[04:20]** though is some form of autonomous

**[04:20]** though is some form of autonomous guidance now that a lot of organization

**[04:23]** guidance now that a lot of organization

**[04:23]** guidance now that a lot of organization are shifting left and and delegating

**[04:25]** are shifting left and and delegating

**[04:25]** are shifting left and and delegating more and more decision making to the to

**[04:28]** more and more decision making to the to

**[04:28]** more and more decision making to the to and empowering the developers which is a

**[04:30]** and empowering the developers which is a

**[04:30]** and empowering the developers which is a great thing. figuring out how to guide

**[04:32]** great thing. figuring out how to guide

**[04:32]** great thing. figuring out how to guide them and equip them with expertise um

**[04:34]** them and equip them with expertise um

**[04:34]** them and equip them with expertise um you know at scale is the third big issue

**[04:37]** you know at scale is the third big issue

**[04:38]** you know at scale is the third big issue that we're that we're constantly facing

**[04:39]** that we're that we're constantly facing

**[04:39]** that we're that we're constantly facing these days. So um and the main reason

**[04:42]** these days. So um and the main reason

**[04:42]** these days. So um and the main reason for these issues is uh you know there's

**[04:45]** for these issues is uh you know there's

**[04:45]** for these issues is uh you know there's there's no dependable live holistic map

**[04:48]** there's no dependable live holistic map

**[04:48]** there's no dependable live holistic map of our services or dependencies and

**[04:51]** of our services or dependencies and

**[04:51]** of our services or dependencies and drift how things change over time really

**[04:53]** drift how things change over time really

**[04:53]** drift how things change over time really there's no baseline from us to go from.

**[04:56]** there's no baseline from us to go from.

**[04:56]** there's no baseline from us to go from. So as a consequence you get slow

**[04:59]** So as a consequence you get slow

**[04:59]** So as a consequence you get slow defensive decisions. You got redundant


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** defensive decisions. You got redundant

**[05:01]** defensive decisions. You got redundant spend you know that you can't justify.

**[05:04]** spend you know that you can't justify.

**[05:04]** spend you know that you can't justify. You know you got risk that's not

**[05:05]** You know you got risk that's not

**[05:05]** You know you got risk that's not properly managed. You know you're

**[05:07]** properly managed. You know you're

**[05:07]** properly managed. You know you're planning you know you mentioned Boris

**[05:09]** planning you know you mentioned Boris

**[05:09]** planning you know you mentioned Boris about you know tribal knowledge and so

**[05:10]** about you know tribal knowledge and so

**[05:10]** about you know tribal knowledge and so on. You're planning basically by opinion

**[05:14]** on. You're planning basically by opinion

**[05:14]** on. You're planning basically by opinion instead of planning by data. So what we

**[05:16]** instead of planning by data. So what we

**[05:16]** instead of planning by data. So what we really need is some kind of live

**[05:18]** really need is some kind of live

**[05:18]** really need is some kind of live visibility that captured all all that

**[05:21]** visibility that captured all all that

**[05:21]** visibility that captured all all that messiness in our system, all that

**[05:23]** messiness in our system, all that

**[05:23]** messiness in our system, all that knowledge and the shifting dependency in

**[05:25]** knowledge and the shifting dependency in

**[05:25]** knowledge and the shifting dependency in essence like a sh like you know the

**[05:28]** essence like a sh like you know the

**[05:28]** essence like a sh like you know the developers have a shared code book a

**[05:30]** developers have a shared code book a

**[05:30]** developers have a shared code book a shared current reality for us for for

**[05:32]** shared current reality for us for for

**[05:32]** shared current reality for us for for our working systems you know because

**[05:34]** our working systems you know because

**[05:34]** our working systems you know because without it really you're making

**[05:36]** without it really you're making

**[05:36]** without it really you're making sometimes multi-million dollar bets

**[05:39]** sometimes multi-million dollar bets

**[05:39]** sometimes multi-million dollar bets without knowing what you already own.

**[05:41]** without knowing what you already own.

**[05:41]** without knowing what you already own. and and you know we've seen that

**[05:42]** and and you know we've seen that

**[05:42]** and and you know we've seen that actually in uh in some of the prospects

**[05:45]** actually in uh in some of the prospects

**[05:45]** actually in uh in some of the prospects some of the people we're talking to

**[05:46]** some of the people we're talking to

**[05:46]** some of the people we're talking to behind closed doors. So

**[05:47]** behind closed doors. So

**[05:47]** behind closed doors. So >> absolutely.

**[05:48]** >> absolutely.

**[05:48]** >> absolutely. >> Yeah. Yeah. So to continue the analogy I

**[05:50]** >> Yeah. Yeah. So to continue the analogy I

**[05:50]** >> Yeah. Yeah. So to continue the analogy I know I'm mixing metaphors using

**[05:52]** know I'm mixing metaphors using

**[05:52]** know I'm mixing metaphors using analogies here but you know to continue

**[05:53]** analogies here but you know to continue

**[05:53]** analogies here but you know to continue the analogy if you want to chart a

**[05:56]** the analogy if you want to chart a

**[05:56]** the analogy if you want to chart a fruitful path forward uh you know what

**[05:59]** fruitful path forward uh you know what


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** fruitful path forward uh you know what you really need is an accurate

**[06:01]** you really need is an accurate

**[06:01]** you really need is an accurate up-to-date map. So when you're charting

**[06:03]** up-to-date map. So when you're charting

**[06:03]** up-to-date map. So when you're charting path forward you need a map. You need

**[06:04]** path forward you need a map. You need

**[06:04]** path forward you need a map. You need some kind of living architecture map

**[06:06]** some kind of living architecture map

**[06:06]** some kind of living architecture map that updates itself as your system

**[06:08]** that updates itself as your system

**[06:08]** that updates itself as your system evolves. So that's kind of like one of

**[06:10]** evolves. So that's kind of like one of

**[06:10]** evolves. So that's kind of like one of the major major things that we're

**[06:11]** the major major things that we're

**[06:11]** the major major things that we're looking for.

**[06:12]** looking for.

**[06:12]** looking for. >> Absolutely. Thanks, Tik. No, completely.

**[06:14]** >> Absolutely. Thanks, Tik. No, completely.

**[06:14]** >> Absolutely. Thanks, Tik. No, completely. So you have visibility.

**[06:15]** So you have visibility.

**[06:15]** So you have visibility. >> Yeah.

**[06:15]** >> Yeah.

**[06:15]** >> Yeah. >> But now what? How do you prioritize? I

**[06:18]** >> But now what? How do you prioritize? I

**[06:18]** >> But now what? How do you prioritize? I know there's a lot of scarce resources.

**[06:20]** know there's a lot of scarce resources.

**[06:20]** know there's a lot of scarce resources. Business wants to achieve some, you

**[06:22]** Business wants to achieve some, you

**[06:22]** Business wants to achieve some, you know, very important objectives, rapid

**[06:24]** know, very important objectives, rapid

**[06:24]** know, very important objectives, rapid growth.

**[06:25]** growth.

**[06:25]** growth. >> Yeah.

**[06:25]** >> Yeah.

**[06:25]** >> Yeah. >> And everyone thinks their project is the

**[06:27]** >> And everyone thinks their project is the

**[06:27]** >> And everyone thinks their project is the key to success,

**[11:28]** thinking about this for quite some time

**[11:28]** thinking about this for quite some time and and we've developed this kind of

**[11:29]** and and we've developed this kind of

**[11:30]** and and we've developed this kind of these three pillars that are really

**[11:32]** these three pillars that are really

**[11:32]** these three pillars that are really really important that together hold up

**[11:34]** really important that together hold up

**[11:34]** really important that together hold up this whole foundation, this whole

**[11:37]** this whole foundation, this whole

**[11:37]** this whole foundation, this whole business of architecture, right? So, the

**[11:39]** business of architecture, right? So, the

**[11:42]** first one is what we call stacks. You

**[11:42]** first one is what we call stacks. You know, it's your live visibility layer.

**[11:44]** know, it's your live visibility layer.

**[11:44]** know, it's your live visibility layer. Remember I talked about the map earlier

**[11:45]** Remember I talked about the map earlier

**[11:45]** Remember I talked about the map earlier having an updated up-to-date map if you

**[11:47]** having an updated up-to-date map if you

**[11:47]** having an updated up-to-date map if you want to chart a course. So in essence

**[11:49]** want to chart a course. So in essence

**[11:49]** want to chart a course. So in essence being able to ingest data across clouds

**[11:52]** being able to ingest data across clouds

**[11:52]** being able to ingest data across clouds across Kubernetes services across

**[12:03]** time and then maintaining this kind of living architecture in form of a digital

**[12:05]** living architecture in form of a digital

**[12:05]** living architecture in form of a digital twin. So you get all that data from

**[12:07]** twin. So you get all that data from

**[12:07]** twin. So you get all that data from everywhere and then you fit it into this

**[12:09]** everywhere and then you fit it into this

**[21:10]** minds at least end to end right the

**[21:10]** minds at least end to end right the first step is to ingest and understand

**[21:13]** first step is to ingest and understand

**[21:13]** first step is to ingest and understand these messy systems right so you're

**[21:15]** these messy systems right so you're

**[21:15]** these messy systems right so you're getting data from everywhere your

**[21:17]** getting data from everywhere your

**[21:17]** getting data from everywhere your systems are messy every system is messy

**[21:19]** systems are messy every system is messy

**[21:19]** systems are messy every system is messy I mean if you say your system is not

**[21:20]** I mean if you say your system is not

**[21:20]** I mean if you say your system is not messy I don't think it's true so you

**[21:23]** messy I don't think it's true so you

**[21:23]** messy I don't think it's true so you take that data and you normalize it to a

**[21:25]** take that data and you normalize it to a

**[21:26]** take that data and you normalize it to a live model this digital twin that we

**[21:27]** live model this digital twin that we

**[21:28]** live model this digital twin that we talk about so now you have it normalized

**[21:30]** talk about so now you have it normalized

**[21:30]** talk about so now you have it normalized in in a in a way that you can look at

**[21:32]** in in a in a way that you can look at

**[21:32]** in in a in a way that you can look at you can introspect you can you can

**[21:34]** you can introspect you can you can

**[21:34]** you can introspect you can you can navigate and so on so and so so having

**[21:36]** navigate and so on so and so so having

**[21:36]** navigate and so on so and so so having that. So now that you have that, the

**[21:38]** that. So now that you have that, the

**[21:38]** that. So now that you have that, the second step is to kind of align yourself

**[21:40]** second step is to kind of align yourself

**[21:40]** second step is to kind of align yourself and and have some kind of align and

**[21:43]** and and have some kind of align and

**[21:43]** and and have some kind of align and advise strategy. So you have your goals,

**[21:45]** advise strategy. So you have your goals,

**[21:45]** advise strategy. So you have your goals, you have your requirements, you have

**[21:47]** you have your requirements, you have

**[21:47]** you have your requirements, you have your context as a company, right? You

**[21:49]** your context as a company, right? You

**[22:39]** you manage things? You can't you can't

**[22:39]** you manage things? You can't you can't manage what you don't measure, right? So

**[22:40]** manage what you don't measure, right? So

**[22:40]** manage what you don't measure, right? So eventually the last step is be able to

**[22:42]** eventually the last step is be able to

**[22:42]** eventually the last step is be able to track these decisions, verify your

**[26:27]** skeptics by nature, right? So, prove out

**[26:27]** skeptics by nature, right? So, prove out the ROI first before you start scaling

**[26:29]** the ROI first before you start scaling

**[26:29]** the ROI first before you start scaling to the to the full hop. That's kind of,

**[26:31]** to the to the full hop. That's kind of,
