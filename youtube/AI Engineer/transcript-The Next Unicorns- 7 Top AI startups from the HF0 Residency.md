**[15:23]** introduce S1, the first ever instructible voice model. It's the only

**[15:26]** instructible voice model. It's the only

**[15:26]** instructible voice model. It's the only model where you can control not just

**[15:28]** model where you can control not just

**[15:28]** model where you can control not just what to say, but how to say it. Here's a

**[15:31]** what to say, but how to say it. Here's a

**[15:31]** what to say, but how to say it. Here's a demo.

**[15:33]** demo.

**[15:33]** demo. >> You can pinpoint focus or draw it

**[15:36]** >> You can pinpoint focus or draw it

**[15:36]** >> You can pinpoint focus or draw it closer. Even yelling while you betray me

**[15:39]** closer. Even yelling while you betray me

**[15:39]** closer. Even yelling while you betray me like this.

**[15:41]** like this.

**[15:41]** like this. >> Yeah, you can control whatever you want.

**[15:44]** >> Yeah, you can control whatever you want.

**[15:44]** >> Yeah, you can control whatever you want. And uh with open audio S1 we have the

**[15:47]** And uh with open audio S1 we have the

**[15:47]** And uh with open audio S1 we have the most expressive voice model in the

**[15:49]** most expressive voice model in the

**[15:49]** most expressive voice model in the world. And the most importantly she will

**[15:52]** world. And the most importantly she will

**[15:52]** world. And the most importantly she will never leave. So

**[15:55]** never leave. So

**[15:55]** never leave. So so we have blown 11 labs out of the

**[15:58]** so we have blown 11 labs out of the

**[15:58]** so we have blown 11 labs out of the water based on the TTS arena ranking and

**[18:58]** So open I want to tell a little bit

**[18:58]** So open I want to tell a little bit about how it started. Um, I co-founded


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:01]** about how it started. Um, I co-founded

**[19:01]** about how it started. Um, I co-founded OpenC in 2017 and in at the end of 2022,

**[19:05]** OpenC in 2017 and in at the end of 2022,

**[19:05]** OpenC in 2017 and in at the end of 2022, I really wanted to know if inference was

**[19:07]** I really wanted to know if inference was

**[19:07]** I really wanted to know if inference was going to be a winner take all market

**[19:09]** going to be a winner take all market

**[19:09]** going to be a winner take all market because the way it looked this could be

**[19:12]** because the way it looked this could be

**[19:12]** because the way it looked this could be the largest market in software that has

**[19:14]** the largest market in software that has

**[19:14]** the largest market in software that has ever happened before.

**[19:16]** ever happened before.

**[19:16]** ever happened before. And uh, the first experiment that we

**[19:19]** And uh, the first experiment that we

**[19:19]** And uh, the first experiment that we tried was building a Chrome extension to

**[19:21]** tried was building a Chrome extension to

**[19:21]** tried was building a Chrome extension to help you bring your own language model

**[19:23]** help you bring your own language model

**[19:23]** help you bring your own language model to any website that supported uh, the

**[19:27]** to any website that supported uh, the

**[19:27]** to any website that supported uh, the protocol. And that eventually evolved

**[19:31]** protocol. And that eventually evolved

**[19:31]** protocol. And that eventually evolved into open router, a single place and a

**[19:34]** into open router, a single place and a

**[19:34]** into open router, a single place and a single API to get all language models uh

**[19:38]** single API to get all language models uh

**[19:38]** single API to get all language models uh with the best prices, best performance

**[19:40]** with the best prices, best performance

**[19:40]** with the best prices, best performance and highest uptime.

**[19:43]** and highest uptime.

**[19:43]** and highest uptime. And the way it works is you just have a

**[19:45]** And the way it works is you just have a

**[19:45]** And the way it works is you just have a single API. You pay once and there's

**[19:47]** single API. You pay once and there's

**[19:47]** single API. You pay once and there's near zero switching costs to move from

**[19:49]** near zero switching costs to move from

**[19:49]** near zero switching costs to move from one model to another. We do all the

**[19:51]** one model to another. We do all the

**[19:51]** one model to another. We do all the heavy work to implement tool calling,

**[19:53]** heavy work to implement tool calling,

**[19:53]** heavy work to implement tool calling, edge cases, caching, and give you the

**[19:55]** edge cases, caching, and give you the

**[19:55]** edge cases, caching, and give you the best prices and performance possible for

**[19:58]** best prices and performance possible for

**[19:58]** best prices and performance possible for your region or wherever your servers are

**[19:59]** your region or wherever your servers are

**[19:59]** your region or wherever your servers are deployed.


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:01]** deployed.

**[20:01]** deployed. And because inference is so important,

**[20:03]** And because inference is so important,

**[20:03]** And because inference is so important, remember this might be the most

**[20:05]** remember this might be the most

**[20:05]** remember this might be the most important software market ever. It

**[20:07]** important software market ever. It

**[20:07]** important software market ever. It deserves its own marketplace just for

**[20:10]** deserves its own marketplace just for

**[20:10]** deserves its own marketplace just for language models optimized for them,

**[20:13]** language models optimized for them,

**[20:13]** language models optimized for them, including filtering for context, for

**[20:18]** features, for tool calling, for structured output, and much more. And so

**[20:20]** structured output, and much more. And so

**[20:20]** structured output, and much more. And so we built that. Then we built a chat room

**[20:24]** we built that. Then we built a chat room

**[20:24]** we built that. Then we built a chat room for you to obviously compare models

**[20:25]** for you to obviously compare models

**[20:25]** for you to obviously compare models head-to-head as simply as you do when

**[20:28]** head-to-head as simply as you do when

**[20:28]** head-to-head as simply as you do when chatting with people in iMessage.

**[20:31]** chatting with people in iMessage.

**[20:32]** chatting with people in iMessage. We built fine grain privacy settings

**[20:33]** We built fine grain privacy settings

**[20:33]** We built fine grain privacy settings including API level controls. We built a

**[20:38]** including API level controls. We built a

**[20:38]** including API level controls. We built a a lot of observability so you could see

**[20:40]** a lot of observability so you could see

**[20:40]** a lot of observability so you could see which models you're using and why. And

**[20:43]** which models you're using and why. And

**[20:43]** which models you're using and why. And we built public data in our rankings

**[20:45]** we built public data in our rankings

**[20:46]** we built public data in our rankings page which has become the go-to place

**[20:47]** page which has become the go-to place

**[20:47]** page which has become the go-to place for comparing models on their real world

**[20:50]** for comparing models on their real world

**[20:50]** for comparing models on their real world usage and on different categories for

**[20:52]** usage and on different categories for

**[20:52]** usage and on different categories for their prompts as well. This has grown

**[20:56]** their prompts as well. This has grown

**[20:56]** their prompts as well. This has grown for the last two months 10 to 100% every

**[20:59]** for the last two months 10 to 100% every


### [21:00 - 22:00]

**[21:00]** for the last two months 10 to 100% every single month or for the last two years

**[21:01]** single month or for the last two years

**[21:05]** 10 to 100% every single month. Uh and

**[21:05]** 10 to 100% every single month. Uh and scaling it has been a lot of the work

**[21:07]** scaling it has been a lot of the work

**[21:07]** scaling it has been a lot of the work that we've done so far. The the

**[21:10]** that we've done so far. The the

**[21:12]** fundamental goal here is to make a

**[21:12]** fundamental goal here is to make a heterogeneous ecosystem homogeneous

**[21:15]** heterogeneous ecosystem homogeneous

**[21:15]** heterogeneous ecosystem homogeneous because we believe inference is a
