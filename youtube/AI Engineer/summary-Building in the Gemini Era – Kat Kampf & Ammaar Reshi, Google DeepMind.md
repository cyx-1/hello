### [Demo 1: Laptop Sticker Generation with Imagen Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=383s)
- Live demonstration of creating laptop sticker illustrations using Imagen Pro
- Uses Google search grounding to find relevant information
- Shows viral trend of generating personalized laptop stickers
- Demonstrates how the model can research a person (Ammaar) and create contextually relevant stickers
- Results include references to his children's book "Alice and Sparkle" and "Weekend builder" persona

### [Demo 2: Comic Book Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=436s)
- Vibe-coded app for creating personalized comic books
- Upload faces of people to include in the story
- Choose genre and language
- Live generation of comic book story about presenting at AI Engineer conference
- Demonstrates:
  - Text rendering in comic book speech bubbles
  - Consistency in character appearances across panels
  - Creative storytelling with humor
  - Interactive story branching (choose your own adventure style)
  - Background details like "AI Engineer" banner rendered accurately

### [Demo 3: Slick Animation Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=493s)
- Showcase of Gemini 3's design sensibilities
- Generated from simple prompt: "create a slick animation website" (with "no cyberpunk" specified)
- Features:
  - Shader animations
  - Smooth page transitions and effects
  - Thoughtful typography selection
  - Professional aesthetic avoiding common AI-generated design pitfalls (purple gradients)
- Demonstrates how non-designers can now create beautiful websites without struggling with tools like Figma

### [Demo 4: AI Studio Export to Anti-Gravity IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=723s)
- Shows how AI Studio is used to build AI Studio itself
- One-shot prompt with screenshot of AI Studio interface
- Asked to clone the UI and add export flow to Anti-Gravity (Google's new agentic IDE)
- Demonstrates creative problem-solving - model generated novel UI patterns not constrained by existing design
- Examples of variations: command line interface for export, status displays, etc.
- Use case for rapid ideation and prototyping of new features

### [Demo 5: 3D Racing Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=823s)
- Simple prompt to create racing game with bot opponent
- Generated 3D racing game using Three.js
- Includes start screen, bot AI, and boost feature
- Demonstrates Gemini 3's capability to create interactive gaming experiences

### [Backend Support & Full-Stack Runtime Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=853s)
- **Major upcoming feature**: Backend support and full-stack runtime coming "very very soon"
- Will enable:
  - Package installation (Shad CN, etc.) with one prompt
  - Express server setup for multiplayer apps
  - Automatic infrastructure decisions (storage, databases, payment solutions)
  - Abstraction of technical details - just describe what you want
- Philosophy: Users shouldn't have to think about implementation details; AI Studio should infer needs from intent

### [Demo 6: Multiplayer Racing Game (Live with Audience)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=883s)
- Risky live demo converting single-player racing game to multiplayer
- Created with "a couple of prompts"
- QR code shared with audience to join the game
- Successfully handled 20+ simultaneous players without crashing
- Demonstrates the power of upcoming backend/full-stack runtime
- Real-time synchronization of player positions and collisions

### [Vision & Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=990s)
- **Democratizing software development**: Building tools for a world where anyone can build software
- Example: Tech support person started vibe coding after watching a YouTube video
- Rethinking traditional paradigms:
  - Not assuming users start from IDE
  - Intuiting user intent as much as possible
  - Automatic infrastructure (storage, payments, etc.) based on app needs
- Goal: Make it as easy as possible to build the future of software

### [Closing & Call to Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkXEIbZpGc&t=1050s)
- Invitation to try Google AI Studio
- Request for audience to share examples and questions on Twitter
- Contact: Kat Kampf and Ammaar Reshi on Twitter
