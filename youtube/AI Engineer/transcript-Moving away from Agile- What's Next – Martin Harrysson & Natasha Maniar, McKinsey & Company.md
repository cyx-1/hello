**[00:22]** Good morning. Hello everyone. It's

**[00:22]** Good morning. Hello everyone. It's really great to be here. Uh so I'm

**[00:24]** really great to be here. Uh so I'm

**[00:24]** really great to be here. Uh so I'm Martin and I'm here with my colleague

**[00:26]** Martin and I'm here with my colleague

**[00:26]** Martin and I'm here with my colleague Natasha. Uh we're from a part of

**[00:28]** Natasha. Uh we're from a part of

**[00:28]** Natasha. Uh we're from a part of Mckenzie. you may may not be as familiar

**[00:31]** Mckenzie. you may may not be as familiar

**[00:31]** Mckenzie. you may may not be as familiar with. We have a practice called software

**[00:33]** with. We have a practice called software

**[00:33]** with. We have a practice called software X and we work with uh mostly enterprise

**[00:36]** X and we work with uh mostly enterprise

**[00:36]** X and we work with uh mostly enterprise clients on how to build better software

**[00:38]** clients on how to build better software

**[00:38]** clients on how to build better software products which has messed mostly using

**[00:41]** products which has messed mostly using

**[00:41]** products which has messed mostly using AI uh in the in the past couple of

**[00:43]** AI uh in the in the past couple of

**[00:43]** AI uh in the in the past couple of years.

**[00:45]** years.

**[00:45]** years. Uh and so what our talk is about today

**[00:48]** Uh and so what our talk is about today

**[00:48]** Uh and so what our talk is about today is really more focused on the people and

**[00:50]** is really more focused on the people and

**[00:50]** is really more focused on the people and the operating model aspects of

**[00:52]** the operating model aspects of

**[00:52]** the operating model aspects of leveraging AI for software development

**[00:55]** leveraging AI for software development

**[00:55]** leveraging AI for software development and and that we believe that that has to

**[00:56]** and and that we believe that that has to

**[00:56]** and and that we believe that that has to change quite significantly and and

**[00:58]** change quite significantly and and

**[00:58]** change quite significantly and and that's what we're excited to talk to you


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** that's what we're excited to talk to you

**[01:00]** that's what we're excited to talk to you about.

**[01:02]** about.

**[01:02]** about. If I take a quick step back uh in in

**[01:05]** If I take a quick step back uh in in

**[01:05]** If I take a quick step back uh in in time and we just uh you know think

**[01:07]** time and we just uh you know think

**[01:07]** time and we just uh you know think through some of these the major

**[01:09]** through some of these the major

**[01:09]** through some of these the major technology breakthroughs that we've seen

**[01:11]** technology breakthroughs that we've seen

**[01:11]** technology breakthroughs that we've seen in the last few decades uh they tend to

**[01:13]** in the last few decades uh they tend to

**[01:13]** in the last few decades uh they tend to always come with a paradigm shift in

**[01:15]** always come with a paradigm shift in

**[01:16]** always come with a paradigm shift in also how we develop software and so I

**[01:18]** also how we develop software and so I

**[01:18]** also how we develop software and so I still recall uh almost 20 years ago now

**[01:20]** still recall uh almost 20 years ago now

**[01:20]** still recall uh almost 20 years ago now I started working as a software engineer

**[01:23]** I started working as a software engineer

**[01:23]** I started working as a software engineer an entry- level developer um in a tech

**[01:25]** an entry- level developer um in a tech

**[01:26]** an entry- level developer um in a tech company and the company I was working

**[01:28]** company and the company I was working

**[01:28]** company and the company I was working for was just switching to to agile we

**[01:30]** for was just switching to to agile we

**[01:30]** for was just switching to to agile we were using camb boards we were

**[01:32]** were using camb boards we were

**[01:32]** were using camb boards we were uh standups and and other ceremonies.

**[01:36]** uh standups and and other ceremonies.

**[01:36]** uh standups and and other ceremonies. This was a big change. It was a massive

**[01:38]** This was a big change. It was a massive

**[01:38]** This was a big change. It was a massive change for the for the company. And now

**[01:41]** change for the for the company. And now

**[01:41]** change for the for the company. And now with everything that is happening

**[01:43]** with everything that is happening

**[01:43]** with everything that is happening happening in AI, we're at the precipice

**[01:45]** happening in AI, we're at the precipice

**[01:45]** happening in AI, we're at the precipice of another such paradigm shift.

**[01:49]** of another such paradigm shift.

**[01:49]** of another such paradigm shift. And

**[01:50]** And

**[01:50]** And um

**[01:52]** um

**[01:52]** um if we think about some of the um some of

**[01:55]** if we think about some of the um some of

**[01:55]** if we think about some of the um some of the things that are happening um with AI

**[01:57]** the things that are happening um with AI

**[01:57]** the things that are happening um with AI and software development that we've seen

**[01:59]** and software development that we've seen

**[01:59]** and software development that we've seen at this um at this conference, there's


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:02]** at this um at this conference, there's

**[02:02]** at this um at this conference, there's no doubt that this is a new paradigm

**[02:04]** no doubt that this is a new paradigm

**[02:04]** no doubt that this is a new paradigm that is about us. And so we'll talk

**[02:06]** that is about us. And so we'll talk

**[02:06]** that is about us. And so we'll talk about two things. uh we'll first touch a

**[02:08]** about two things. uh we'll first touch a

**[02:08]** about two things. uh we'll first touch a little bit about how do you go from

**[02:10]** little bit about how do you go from

**[02:10]** little bit about how do you go from these things that we're seeing at

**[02:12]** these things that we're seeing at

**[02:12]** these things that we're seeing at individual productivity to scaling that

**[02:15]** individual productivity to scaling that

**[02:15]** individual productivity to scaling that to the whole team and what that what

**[02:16]** to the whole team and what that what

**[02:16]** to the whole team and what that what type of changes we think that implies

**[02:18]** type of changes we think that implies

**[02:18]** type of changes we think that implies and then we'll talk a little bit uh

**[02:20]** and then we'll talk a little bit uh

**[02:20]** and then we'll talk a little bit uh about how do you scale that across uh a

**[02:23]** about how do you scale that across uh a

**[02:23]** about how do you scale that across uh a whole organization and to really get get

**[02:25]** whole organization and to really get get

**[02:25]** whole organization and to really get get value

**[02:30]** um

**[02:30]** um if if you sort of I'm talking to an

**[02:32]** if if you sort of I'm talking to an

**[02:32]** if if you sort of I'm talking to an audience here which is using a agents

**[02:35]** audience here which is using a agents

**[02:35]** audience here which is using a agents all the time and I thought if I If I

**[02:37]** all the time and I thought if I If I

**[02:37]** all the time and I thought if I If I asked you about some examples, I'm sure

**[02:39]** asked you about some examples, I'm sure

**[02:39]** asked you about some examples, I'm sure you could rattle off, you know, 10

**[02:41]** you could rattle off, you know, 10

**[02:41]** you could rattle off, you know, 10 different ones where you would say,

**[02:43]** different ones where you would say,

**[02:43]** different ones where you would say, "Look, there was this thing that I used

**[02:44]** "Look, there was this thing that I used

**[02:44]** "Look, there was this thing that I used to do. It it used to take uh maybe even

**[02:48]** to do. It it used to take uh maybe even

**[02:48]** to do. It it used to take uh maybe even days and and and hours that are now

**[02:51]** days and and and hours that are now

**[02:51]** days and and and hours that are now taking only minutes, right? There's no

**[02:53]** taking only minutes, right? There's no

**[02:53]** taking only minutes, right? There's no shortage of those those stories and you

**[02:55]** shortage of those those stories and you

**[02:55]** shortage of those those stories and you can go over to the expo and and talk to

**[02:58]** can go over to the expo and and talk to

**[02:58]** can go over to the expo and and talk to any of the companies there about all


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** any of the companies there about all

**[03:00]** any of the companies there about all these all these great use cases. It

**[03:02]** these all these great use cases. It

**[03:02]** these all these great use cases. It really shows that these tools work and

**[03:03]** really shows that these tools work and

**[03:03]** really shows that these tools work and they can be really impactful." And so

**[03:06]** they can be really impactful." And so

**[03:06]** they can be really impactful." And so yet despite seeing you know some of

**[03:08]** yet despite seeing you know some of

**[03:08]** yet despite seeing you know some of these uh improvement uh improvements

**[03:12]** these uh improvement uh improvements

**[03:12]** these uh improvement uh improvements uh we've done some research to gauge you

**[03:15]** uh we've done some research to gauge you

**[03:15]** uh we've done some research to gauge you know where are our clients at the

**[03:16]** know where are our clients at the

**[03:16]** know where are our clients at the moment. We we recently surveyed about

**[03:19]** moment. We we recently surveyed about

**[03:19]** moment. We we recently surveyed about 300 uh companies uh mostly enterprises

**[03:22]** 300 uh companies uh mostly enterprises

**[03:22]** 300 uh companies uh mostly enterprises around what are they seeing in terms of

**[03:24]** around what are they seeing in terms of

**[03:24]** around what are they seeing in terms of productivity improvements. So you have

**[03:26]** productivity improvements. So you have

**[03:26]** productivity improvements. So you have this and then they would say uh on

**[03:29]** this and then they would say uh on

**[03:29]** this and then they would say uh on average we're often seeing only 5 10 15%

**[03:33]** average we're often seeing only 5 10 15%

**[03:33]** average we're often seeing only 5 10 15% improvements overall as as a company. So

**[03:36]** improvements overall as as a company. So

**[03:36]** improvements overall as as a company. So we're in a place where there's a bit of

**[03:37]** we're in a place where there's a bit of

**[03:37]** we're in a place where there's a bit of a disconnect between this this big

**[03:40]** a disconnect between this this big

**[03:40]** a disconnect between this this big potential uh around AI as uh from the

**[03:43]** potential uh around AI as uh from the

**[03:43]** potential uh around AI as uh from the reality

**[03:45]** reality

**[03:45]** reality and so we we think that um there is this

**[03:49]** and so we we think that um there is this

**[03:49]** and so we we think that um there is this gap because as we've started

**[03:51]** gap because as we've started

**[03:51]** gap because as we've started implementing AI whether it's um you know

**[03:54]** implementing AI whether it's um you know

**[03:54]** implementing AI whether it's um you know coding assistance or whether it's now

**[03:56]** coding assistance or whether it's now

**[03:56]** coding assistance or whether it's now using you know you just heard about uh

**[03:59]** using you know you just heard about uh

**[03:59]** using you know you just heard about uh you know how open AI is using agents and


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:02]** you know how open AI is using agents and

**[04:02]** you know how open AI is using agents and more complex uh workflows what has

**[04:05]** more complex uh workflows what has

**[04:05]** more complex uh workflows what has started to emerge is a is a set of

**[04:06]** started to emerge is a is a set of

**[04:06]** started to emerge is a is a set of bottlenecks

**[04:08]** bottlenecks

**[04:08]** bottlenecks uh that that were not necessarily there

**[04:11]** uh that that were not necessarily there

**[04:11]** uh that that were not necessarily there before. Like for for example, as we now

**[04:14]** before. Like for for example, as we now

**[04:14]** before. Like for for example, as we now start moving much faster in certain in

**[04:16]** start moving much faster in certain in

**[04:16]** start moving much faster in certain in certain aspects of the work, uh we

**[04:19]** certain aspects of the work, uh we

**[04:19]** certain aspects of the work, uh we haven't really changed how we

**[04:20]** haven't really changed how we

**[04:20]** haven't really changed how we collaborate among people and and team

**[04:22]** collaborate among people and and team

**[04:22]** collaborate among people and and team members. That's not quite keeping up.

**[04:25]** members. That's not quite keeping up.

**[04:25]** members. That's not quite keeping up. We started generating way more more

**[04:27]** We started generating way more more

**[04:27]** We started generating way more more code, but we're it's still being

**[04:28]** code, but we're it's still being

**[04:28]** code, but we're it's still being reviewed in a in a pretty manual way in

**[04:30]** reviewed in a in a pretty manual way in

**[04:30]** reviewed in a in a pretty manual way in in many companies, right? And then we

**[04:33]** in many companies, right? And then we

**[04:33]** in many companies, right? And then we also have this this theme which was

**[04:35]** also have this this theme which was

**[04:35]** also have this this theme which was recently highlighted in in even a

**[04:37]** recently highlighted in in even a

**[04:37]** recently highlighted in in even a research report from from Carnegie Melon

**[04:39]** research report from from Carnegie Melon

**[04:39]** research report from from Carnegie Melon uh about how all the new code that is

**[04:42]** uh about how all the new code that is

**[04:42]** uh about how all the new code that is being generated is also amplifying uh

**[04:44]** being generated is also amplifying uh

**[04:44]** being generated is also amplifying uh the generation of tech debt in some in

**[04:46]** the generation of tech debt in some in

**[04:46]** the generation of tech debt in some in some cases and actually generating

**[04:48]** some cases and actually generating

**[04:48]** some cases and actually generating complexity. And so there are these

**[04:51]** complexity. And so there are these

**[04:51]** complexity. And so there are these bottlenecks. They're not impossible to

**[04:53]** bottlenecks. They're not impossible to

**[04:53]** bottlenecks. They're not impossible to overcome but this is what we believe is

**[04:55]** overcome but this is what we believe is

**[04:55]** overcome but this is what we believe is limiting uh many companies from seeing

**[04:57]** limiting uh many companies from seeing

**[04:57]** limiting uh many companies from seeing the the the real value that that they

**[04:59]** the the the real value that that they

**[04:59]** the the the real value that that they should be seeing.


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** should be seeing.

**[05:02]** should be seeing. Let me talk about maybe just a couple of

**[05:04]** Let me talk about maybe just a couple of

**[05:04]** Let me talk about maybe just a couple of examples to to make that uh come to life

**[05:07]** examples to to make that uh come to life

**[05:07]** examples to to make that uh come to life a little bit more. One of the things

**[05:09]** a little bit more. One of the things

**[05:09]** a little bit more. One of the things that we see as a big rate limiter at the

**[05:12]** that we see as a big rate limiter at the

**[05:12]** that we see as a big rate limiter at the moment is around how work is allocated.

**[05:14]** moment is around how work is allocated.

**[05:14]** moment is around how work is allocated. And so what what we've learned over the

**[05:16]** And so what what we've learned over the

**[05:16]** And so what what we've learned over the last couple of years is that the impact

**[05:18]** last couple of years is that the impact

**[05:18]** last couple of years is that the impact from AI and agents is highly uneven.

**[05:21]** from AI and agents is highly uneven.

**[05:21]** from AI and agents is highly uneven. There are some tasks which where it

**[05:22]** There are some tasks which where it

**[05:22]** There are some tasks which where it works amazingly well today and you see u

**[05:26]** works amazingly well today and you see u

**[05:26]** works amazingly well today and you see u huge improvements and there are others

**[05:27]** huge improvements and there are others

**[05:27]** huge improvements and there are others where it it's not as effective and so

**[05:30]** where it it's not as effective and so

**[05:30]** where it it's not as effective and so you have that variability. You also have

**[05:32]** you have that variability. You also have

**[05:32]** you have that variability. You also have variability among people. Some have have

**[05:34]** variability among people. Some have have

**[05:34]** variability among people. Some have have uh lots of experience now using these

**[05:36]** uh lots of experience now using these

**[05:36]** uh lots of experience now using these tools and and know how to pick that up

**[05:39]** tools and and know how to pick that up

**[05:39]** tools and and know how to pick that up and others uh are less experienced.

**[05:41]** and others uh are less experienced.

**[05:41]** and others uh are less experienced. Right? And so what that means for for

**[05:43]** Right? And so what that means for for

**[05:43]** Right? And so what that means for for team leaders, for engineering managers

**[05:45]** team leaders, for engineering managers

**[05:45]** team leaders, for engineering managers and so on is it's very highly

**[05:48]** and so on is it's very highly

**[05:48]** and so on is it's very highly non-trivial to know how to allocate work

**[05:50]** non-trivial to know how to allocate work

**[05:50]** non-trivial to know how to allocate work and resources in in a good way. And this

**[05:53]** and resources in in a good way. And this

**[05:53]** and resources in in a good way. And this is creating a lot of inefficiencies.

**[05:56]** is creating a lot of inefficiencies.

**[05:56]** is creating a lot of inefficiencies. Another example uh is is around how work

**[05:59]** Another example uh is is around how work


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** Another example uh is is around how work is being reviewed. So agents are often

**[06:02]** is being reviewed. So agents are often

**[06:02]** is being reviewed. So agents are often giving given pretty uh fuzzy uh you know

**[06:06]** giving given pretty uh fuzzy uh you know

**[06:06]** giving given pretty uh fuzzy uh you know stories that are written in pros with

**[06:08]** stories that are written in pros with

**[06:08]** stories that are written in pros with pretty fuzzy acceptance criteria uh

**[06:11]** pretty fuzzy acceptance criteria uh

**[06:11]** pretty fuzzy acceptance criteria uh which which means that the code that

**[06:13]** which which means that the code that

**[06:13]** which which means that the code that comes back is not always what it was

**[06:14]** comes back is not always what it was

**[06:14]** comes back is not always what it was intended to be and and for many

**[06:17]** intended to be and and for many

**[06:17]** intended to be and and for many companies the only mechanism to control

**[06:19]** companies the only mechanism to control

**[06:19]** companies the only mechanism to control that is is often manual review. So

**[06:22]** that is is often manual review. So

**[06:22]** that is is often manual review. So you've automated some things but we've

**[06:23]** you've automated some things but we've

**[06:23]** you've automated some things but we've generated more manual review. So these

**[06:25]** generated more manual review. So these

**[06:26]** generated more manual review. So these are some of the some of the examples of

**[06:28]** are some of the some of the examples of

**[06:28]** are some of the some of the examples of uh this bottleneck that we that we see

**[06:30]** uh this bottleneck that we that we see

**[06:30]** uh this bottleneck that we that we see coming up

**[06:32]** coming up

**[06:32]** coming up and as mentioned what what has that has

**[06:34]** and as mentioned what what has that has

**[06:34]** and as mentioned what what has that has resulted in so far is that most most

**[06:38]** resulted in so far is that most most

**[06:38]** resulted in so far is that most most large companies today uh are are stuck a

**[06:41]** large companies today uh are are stuck a

**[06:41]** large companies today uh are are stuck a little bit in in a world of relatively

**[06:44]** little bit in in a world of relatively

**[06:44]** little bit in in a world of relatively marginal gains. Uh they're working in

**[06:47]** marginal gains. Uh they're working in

**[06:47]** marginal gains. Uh they're working in ways that was developed with constraints

**[06:50]** ways that was developed with constraints

**[06:50]** ways that was developed with constraints that we had in the past paradigm of

**[06:52]** that we had in the past paradigm of

**[06:52]** that we had in the past paradigm of human development. So you have you you

**[06:54]** human development. So you have you you

**[06:54]** human development. So you have you you know if you go out to most companies you

**[06:56]** know if you go out to most companies you

**[06:56]** know if you go out to most companies you see 8 to 10 person teams you see working

**[06:59]** see 8 to 10 person teams you see working

**[06:59]** see 8 to 10 person teams you see working in two week sprints you have all these


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** in two week sprints you have all these

**[07:01]** in two week sprints you have all these these elements that were largely parts

**[07:03]** these elements that were largely parts

**[07:03]** these elements that were largely parts of like an of an agile operating uh

**[07:06]** of like an of an agile operating uh

**[07:06]** of like an of an agile operating uh model and that is and that is uh putting

**[07:08]** model and that is and that is uh putting

**[07:08]** model and that is and that is uh putting in some some limits to what they can

**[07:10]** in some some limits to what they can

**[07:10]** in some some limits to what they can see. Over the past year, we've been

**[07:13]** see. Over the past year, we've been

**[07:13]** see. Over the past year, we've been working with lots of clients to to sort

**[07:16]** working with lots of clients to to sort

**[07:16]** working with lots of clients to to sort of break that model a bit uh and develop

**[07:18]** of break that model a bit uh and develop

**[07:18]** of break that model a bit uh and develop new ways of of working in smaller teams,

**[07:21]** new ways of of working in smaller teams,

**[07:21]** new ways of of working in smaller teams, in new roles, uh in with shorter cycles.

**[07:25]** in new roles, uh in with shorter cycles.

**[07:25]** in new roles, uh in with shorter cycles. And when you do that, we see really

**[07:27]** And when you do that, we see really

**[07:27]** And when you do that, we see really great performance improvements. And

**[07:29]** great performance improvements. And

**[07:29]** great performance improvements. And that's what gives you gives us this uh

**[07:31]** that's what gives you gives us this uh

**[07:31]** that's what gives you gives us this uh path to where we see things are going to

**[07:33]** path to where we see things are going to

**[07:33]** path to where we see things are going to improve.

**[07:36]** improve.

**[07:39]** So we realized that rewiring the PDLC is

**[07:39]** So we realized that rewiring the PDLC is not just a one-sizefits-all solution.

**[07:42]** not just a one-sizefits-all solution.

**[07:42]** not just a one-sizefits-all solution. For example, different types of

**[10:49]** some steps you can take? So in in a recent client study with a leading

**[10:51]** recent client study with a leading

**[10:51]** recent client study with a leading international bank, we tested some team

**[10:53]** international bank, we tested some team

**[10:53]** international bank, we tested some team level interventions to address the

**[10:58]** bottlenecks previously mentioned before

**[10:58]** bottlenecks previously mentioned before mainly around the sequencing of steps


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** mainly around the sequencing of steps

**[11:00]** mainly around the sequencing of steps within the agile ceremony and how uh to

**[11:03]** within the agile ceremony and how uh to

**[11:03]** within the agile ceremony and how uh to define the roles of agents and humans

**[11:05]** define the roles of agents and humans

**[11:05]** define the roles of agents and humans within the sprint cycle. So let's walk

**[11:08]** within the sprint cycle. So let's walk

**[11:08]** within the sprint cycle. So let's walk through some examples.

**[11:09]** through some examples.

**[11:10]** through some examples. First, team leads would assign sprint

**[11:12]** First, team leads would assign sprint

**[11:12]** First, team leads would assign sprint stories using agents based on the data

**[11:15]** stories using agents based on the data

**[11:15]** stories using agents based on the data of the team velocity and delivery

**[11:17]** of the team velocity and delivery

**[11:17]** of the team velocity and delivery history. And then they would create

**[11:19]** history. And then they would create

**[11:19]** history. And then they would create co-create multiple prototypes and

**[11:21]** co-create multiple prototypes and

**[11:21]** co-create multiple prototypes and iterate with agents on the acceptance

**[11:23]** iterate with agents on the acceptance

**[11:23]** iterate with agents on the acceptance criteria around security and

**[11:25]** criteria around security and

**[11:25]** criteria around security and observability needs to have more

**[11:27]** observability needs to have more

**[11:27]** observability needs to have more consistent artifacts across teams. This

**[11:30]** consistent artifacts across teams. This

**[11:30]** consistent artifacts across teams. This prevents downstream rework that was

**[11:32]** prevents downstream rework that was

**[11:32]** prevents downstream rework that was mentioned before so that developers

**[11:35]** mentioned before so that developers

**[11:35]** mentioned before so that developers don't have to constantly be iterating

**[11:36]** don't have to constantly be iterating

**[11:36]** don't have to constantly be iterating with the agents during during the code

**[11:38]** with the agents during during the code

**[11:38]** with the agents during during the code process. The squads were also

**[11:41]** process. The squads were also

**[11:41]** process. The squads were also reorganized by workflow. So there would

**[11:43]** reorganized by workflow. So there would

**[11:43]** reorganized by workflow. So there would be one which would be focused on um

**[11:46]** be one which would be focused on um

**[11:46]** be one which would be focused on um small bug fixes and another focused on

**[11:48]** small bug fixes and another focused on

**[11:48]** small bug fixes and another focused on green field development. In the

**[11:50]** green field development. In the

**[11:50]** green field development. In the background agents would be used to look

**[11:53]** background agents would be used to look

**[11:53]** background agents would be used to look and impact uh look at um the potential

**[11:57]** and impact uh look at um the potential

**[11:57]** and impact uh look at um the potential cross repository impacts um to prevent


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** cross repository impacts um to prevent

**[12:00]** cross repository impacts um to prevent debugging time for developers.

**[12:03]** debugging time for developers.

**[12:04]** debugging time for developers. And another example is that instead of

**[12:06]** And another example is that instead of

**[12:06]** And another example is that instead of for reducing the collaboration overhead

**[12:08]** for reducing the collaboration overhead

**[12:08]** for reducing the collaboration overhead and meetings that happen within the

**[12:10]** and meetings that happen within the

**[12:10]** and meetings that happen within the sprint cycle, um instead of waiting for

**[12:13]** sprint cycle, um instead of waiting for

**[12:13]** sprint cycle, um instead of waiting for data scientists input, PMS would

**[12:15]** data scientists input, PMS would

**[12:15]** data scientists input, PMS would directly be observing the real-time

**[12:18]** directly be observing the real-time

**[12:18]** directly be observing the real-time customer feedback to rep prioritize

**[12:19]** customer feedback to rep prioritize

**[12:20]** customer feedback to rep prioritize these features

**[12:22]** these features

**[12:22]** these features and this would lead to an acceleration

**[12:24]** and this would lead to an acceleration

**[12:24]** and this would lead to an acceleration in the backlog within the same amount of

**[12:26]** in the backlog within the same amount of

**[12:26]** in the backlog within the same amount of time.

**[12:28]** time.

**[12:28]** time. So we studied the um impact of these

**[12:31]** So we studied the um impact of these

**[12:31]** So we studied the um impact of these interventions and found high promising

**[12:33]** interventions and found high promising

**[12:34]** interventions and found high promising results. For example, not just the

**[12:37]** results. For example, not just the

**[12:37]** results. For example, not just the increase in agent consumption by over 60

**[12:39]** increase in agent consumption by over 60

**[12:39]** increase in agent consumption by over 60 times, but there was also an increase in

**[12:41]** times, but there was also an increase in

**[12:41]** times, but there was also an increase in the delivery speed that was tied

**[12:43]** the delivery speed that was tied

**[12:43]** the delivery speed that was tied directly to the business priorities for

**[12:46]** directly to the business priorities for

**[12:46]** directly to the business priorities for this bank. There was a 51% increase in

**[12:49]** this bank. There was a 51% increase in

**[12:49]** this bank. There was a 51% increase in code mergers, but also a decrease in um

**[12:52]** code mergers, but also a decrease in um

**[12:52]** code mergers, but also a decrease in um an increase in efficiency.

**[12:56]** an increase in efficiency.

**[12:56]** an increase in efficiency. The other aspect of this is is uh around

**[12:58]** The other aspect of this is is uh around

**[12:58]** The other aspect of this is is uh around the different roles and and and the


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** the different roles and and and the

**[13:00]** the different roles and and and the talent model. And so one of the biggest

**[13:03]** talent model. And so one of the biggest

**[13:03]** talent model. And so one of the biggest differentiators that we saw as mentioned

**[13:05]** differentiators that we saw as mentioned

**[13:05]** differentiators that we saw as mentioned was around but you have actually changed

**[13:08]** was around but you have actually changed

**[13:08]** was around but you have actually changed the roles that uh that are involved in

**[13:10]** the roles that uh that are involved in

**[13:10]** the roles that uh that are involved in software development. And so you know

**[13:12]** software development. And so you know

**[13:12]** software development. And so you know what what you all are seeing is that

**[13:14]** what what you all are seeing is that

**[13:14]** what what you all are seeing is that engineers are moving away from execution

**[13:17]** engineers are moving away from execution

**[13:17]** engineers are moving away from execution and and just simply writing code to

**[13:19]** and and just simply writing code to

**[13:19]** and and just simply writing code to being more of orchestrators and and

**[13:21]** being more of orchestrators and and

**[13:21]** being more of orchestrators and and thinking through more how to divide up

**[13:23]** thinking through more how to divide up

**[13:23]** thinking through more how to divide up work to agents. for example. And we also

**[13:26]** work to agents. for example. And we also

**[13:26]** work to agents. for example. And we also heard some examples of how the role of

**[13:28]** heard some examples of how the role of

**[13:28]** heard some examples of how the role of the product manager is changing. And so

**[13:30]** the product manager is changing. And so

**[13:30]** the product manager is changing. And so while this this may sound, you know,

**[13:32]** while this this may sound, you know,

**[13:32]** while this this may sound, you know, pretty straightforward to many of you

**[13:34]** pretty straightforward to many of you

**[13:34]** pretty straightforward to many of you here who are who are working with these

**[13:36]** here who are who are working with these

**[13:36]** here who are who are working with these tools like day-to-day that you have to

**[13:38]** tools like day-to-day that you have to

**[13:38]** tools like day-to-day that you have to change what you do, the reality is that

**[13:41]** change what you do, the reality is that

**[13:41]** change what you do, the reality is that about 70% of the companies that we that

**[13:43]** about 70% of the companies that we that

**[13:43]** about 70% of the companies that we that we survey have have not changed their

**[13:45]** we survey have have not changed their

**[13:45]** we survey have have not changed their roles at all. Right? And so you have

**[13:47]** roles at all. Right? And so you have

**[13:47]** roles at all. Right? And so you have this background expectation that people

**[13:49]** this background expectation that people

**[13:49]** this background expectation that people are going to do things differently but

**[13:51]** are going to do things differently but

**[13:51]** are going to do things differently but uh the the role is still defined in the

**[13:53]** uh the the role is still defined in the

**[13:53]** uh the the role is still defined in the same way and it's the same understanding

**[13:55]** same way and it's the same understanding

**[13:55]** same way and it's the same understanding uh as it was you know a couple of years

**[13:57]** uh as it was you know a couple of years

**[13:57]** uh as it was you know a couple of years ago.

**[13:58]** ago.

**[13:58]** ago. Um but we are starting to see you know


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** Um but we are starting to see you know

**[14:01]** Um but we are starting to see you know some companies changing this. So this is

**[14:03]** some companies changing this. So this is

**[14:03]** some companies changing this. So this is another example from a from another

**[14:05]** another example from a from another

**[14:05]** another example from a from another recent nent client. They were set up in

**[14:08]** recent nent client. They were set up in

**[14:08]** recent nent client. They were set up in a in a way that is, you know, probably

**[14:10]** a in a way that is, you know, probably

**[14:10]** a in a way that is, you know, probably pretty common for for u many companies

**[14:12]** pretty common for for u many companies

**[14:12]** pretty common for for u many companies and a kind of typical two pizza uh team

**[14:16]** and a kind of typical two pizza uh team

**[14:16]** and a kind of typical two pizza uh team model with with the types of roles that

**[14:18]** model with with the types of roles that

**[14:18]** model with with the types of roles that you would be familiar with. Um the we

**[14:22]** you would be familiar with. Um the we

**[14:22]** you would be familiar with. Um the we ran a bunch of experiments and front

**[14:24]** ran a bunch of experiments and front

**[14:24]** ran a bunch of experiments and front runners and and tested new models that

**[14:26]** runners and and tested new models that

**[14:26]** runners and and tested new models that were had much smaller pods uh that had

**[14:30]** were had much smaller pods uh that had

**[14:30]** were had much smaller pods uh that had uh new roles which consolidated some of

**[14:33]** uh new roles which consolidated some of

**[14:33]** uh new roles which consolidated some of the tasks that were previously done with

**[14:35]** the tasks that were previously done with

**[14:35]** the tasks that were previously done with different roles.

**[14:37]** different roles.

**[14:37]** different roles. And and so by doing that we could we

**[14:40]** And and so by doing that we could we

**[14:40]** And and so by doing that we could we could create basically more pods or more

**[14:42]** could create basically more pods or more

**[14:42]** could create basically more pods or more teams uh with with the same number of

**[14:44]** teams uh with with the same number of

**[14:44]** teams uh with with the same number of people uh but retaining the expectation

**[14:47]** people uh but retaining the expectation

**[14:47]** people uh but retaining the expectation that each pod is is uh is um performing

**[14:50]** that each pod is is uh is um performing

**[14:50]** that each pod is is uh is um performing at about the same level as as they were

**[14:52]** at about the same level as as they were

**[14:52]** at about the same level as as they were before.

**[14:54]** before.

**[14:54]** before. And so so we also see really uh really

**[14:57]** And so so we also see really uh really

**[14:58]** And so so we also see really uh really positive results from that uh with with


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:01]** positive results from that uh with with

**[15:01]** positive results from that uh with with uh maintaining and even improving in

**[15:03]** uh maintaining and even improving in

**[15:03]** uh maintaining and even improving in some is the quality of the code that was

**[15:05]** some is the quality of the code that was

**[15:05]** some is the quality of the code that was generated. In particular there was a

**[15:07]** generated. In particular there was a

**[15:10]** there was a high speed up in in terms of

**[15:10]** there was a high speed up in in terms of uh the output from from the different

**[15:12]** uh the output from from the different

**[15:12]** uh the output from from the different teams and you can see some of the

**[15:13]** teams and you can see some of the

**[15:13]** teams and you can see some of the metrics uh here.

**[15:19]** Let's shift gears a little bit and and

**[15:19]** Let's shift gears a little bit and and and go from talking about just the team

**[15:21]** and go from talking about just the team

**[15:21]** and go from talking about just the team level. So how does this now scale uh

**[15:23]** level. So how does this now scale uh

**[15:23]** level. So how does this now scale uh across a big organization?

**[15:26]** across a big organization?

**[15:26]** across a big organization? The reality is that many many companies

**[15:30]** The reality is that many many companies

**[15:30]** The reality is that many many companies don't just have like one or two of these

**[15:31]** don't just have like one or two of these

**[15:31]** don't just have like one or two of these these teams but often hundreds of teams

**[15:34]** these teams but often hundreds of teams

**[15:34]** these teams but often hundreds of teams even and thousands or even tens of

**[15:36]** even and thousands or even tens of

**[15:36]** even and thousands or even tens of thousands of people who are working in

**[15:38]** thousands of people who are working in

**[15:38]** thousands of people who are working in this way. And uh this is where one of

**[15:42]** this way. And uh this is where one of

**[15:42]** this way. And uh this is where one of the biggest differences that we that we

**[15:44]** the biggest differences that we that we

**[15:44]** the biggest differences that we that we saw between those that are stuck a bit

**[15:46]** saw between those that are stuck a bit

**[15:46]** saw between those that are stuck a bit in the um in in getting only 10% or so

**[15:50]** in the um in in getting only 10% or so

**[15:50]** in the um in in getting only 10% or so change improvements from those who are

**[15:52]** change improvements from those who are

**[15:52]** change improvements from those who are seeing outsized improvements is around

**[15:54]** seeing outsized improvements is around

**[15:54]** seeing outsized improvements is around how you manage that how you manage that

**[15:56]** how you manage that how you manage that

**[15:56]** how you manage that how you manage that change and change management I guess is

**[15:59]** change and change management I guess is

**[15:59]** change and change management I guess is like one of these a little bit of an


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:01]** like one of these a little bit of an

**[16:01]** like one of these a little bit of an often catch or elusive term for uh for a

**[16:05]** often catch or elusive term for uh for a

**[16:05]** often catch or elusive term for uh for a lot of different things but but I think

**[16:07]** lot of different things but but I think

**[16:07]** lot of different things but but I think in some ways it's not a bad way to think

**[16:09]** in some ways it's not a bad way to think

**[16:09]** in some ways it's not a bad way to think about I I usually say that the change

**[16:11]** about I I usually say that the change

**[16:11]** about I I usually say that the change management is about getting a lot of

**[16:13]** management is about getting a lot of

**[16:13]** management is about getting a lot of like small things right. And so the crux

**[16:16]** like small things right. And so the crux

**[16:16]** like small things right. And so the crux to like actually scaling this is often

**[16:17]** to like actually scaling this is often

**[16:18]** to like actually scaling this is often about getting 20 30 or even more things

**[16:21]** about getting 20 30 or even more things

**[16:21]** about getting 20 30 or even more things right at the same time that involve the

**[16:23]** right at the same time that involve the

**[16:23]** right at the same time that involve the way you communicate uh what this means,

**[16:26]** way you communicate uh what this means,

**[16:26]** way you communicate uh what this means, the way you incentivize people, uh the

**[16:28]** the way you incentivize people, uh the

**[16:28]** the way you incentivize people, uh the way you upskill them, and it all has to

**[16:30]** way you upskill them, and it all has to

**[16:30]** way you upskill them, and it all has to come together.

**[16:32]** come together.

**[16:32]** come together. Um and when it when it's not, we we we

**[16:35]** Um and when it when it's not, we we we

**[16:35]** Um and when it when it's not, we we we see what happens. And so this is an

**[16:37]** see what happens. And so this is an

**[16:37]** see what happens. And so this is an example from from another tech company

**[16:39]** example from from another tech company

**[16:39]** example from from another tech company that we worked with um where initially

**[16:43]** that we worked with um where initially

**[16:43]** that we worked with um where initially we're rolling out new AI tools for them

**[16:45]** we're rolling out new AI tools for them

**[16:45]** we're rolling out new AI tools for them that that hit different parts of the

**[16:47]** that that hit different parts of the

**[16:47]** that that hit different parts of the product development life cycle. Um we we

**[16:51]** product development life cycle. Um we we

**[16:51]** product development life cycle. Um we we rolled we rolled out the tools there was

**[16:52]** rolled we rolled out the tools there was

**[16:52]** rolled we rolled out the tools there was some usage but often it dropped off. It

**[16:54]** some usage but often it dropped off. It

**[16:54]** some usage but often it dropped off. It was either not used or it was um it was

**[16:57]** was either not used or it was um it was

**[16:57]** was either not used or it was um it was sort of um used in very suboptimal ways.


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:00]** sort of um used in very suboptimal ways.

**[17:00]** sort of um used in very suboptimal ways. So that's the sort of jagged part that

**[17:02]** So that's the sort of jagged part that

**[17:02]** So that's the sort of jagged part that you're seeing on the on the left hand

**[17:03]** you're seeing on the on the left hand

**[17:03]** you're seeing on the on the left hand side here. despite kind of adding more

**[17:06]** side here. despite kind of adding more

**[17:06]** side here. despite kind of adding more users uh the overall impact did not

**[17:09]** users uh the overall impact did not

**[17:09]** users uh the overall impact did not change at all. So we had to do a quite a

**[17:11]** change at all. So we had to do a quite a

**[17:11]** change at all. So we had to do a quite a reset and and um start over effectively

**[17:15]** reset and and um start over effectively

**[17:15]** reset and and um start over effectively reset the expectations. What should what

**[17:17]** reset the expectations. What should what

**[17:17]** reset the expectations. What should what what does this mean if you're a

**[17:19]** what does this mean if you're a

**[17:19]** what does this mean if you're a developer dayto-day? What does it mean

**[17:20]** developer dayto-day? What does it mean

**[17:20]** developer dayto-day? What does it mean for a PM? Uh we had much more hands-on

**[17:23]** for a PM? Uh we had much more hands-on

**[17:23]** for a PM? Uh we had much more hands-on upskilling. There was could bring your

**[17:25]** upskilling. There was could bring your

**[17:25]** upskilling. There was could bring your own code. there were, you know, coaches

**[17:27]** own code. there were, you know, coaches

**[17:27]** own code. there were, you know, coaches available, especially those first like

**[17:29]** available, especially those first like

**[17:29]** available, especially those first like few sprints before you get make this a

**[17:32]** few sprints before you get make this a

**[17:32]** few sprints before you get make this a habit and work it into the way that you

**[17:34]** habit and work it into the way that you

**[17:34]** habit and work it into the way that you develop software dayto-day. It's a very

**[17:36]** develop software dayto-day. It's a very

**[17:36]** develop software dayto-day. It's a very critical time and that's when when this

**[17:39]** critical time and that's when when this

**[17:39]** critical time and that's when when this matters a lot. Um, and having a bit of a

**[17:42]** matters a lot. Um, and having a bit of a

**[17:42]** matters a lot. Um, and having a bit of a a measurement system as well, so you

**[17:44]** a measurement system as well, so you

**[17:44]** a measurement system as well, so you know what's changing and and you're able

**[17:46]** know what's changing and and you're able

**[17:46]** know what's changing and and you're able to to see what's uh what's what what's

**[17:49]** to to see what's uh what's what what's

**[17:49]** to to see what's uh what's what what's improving.

**[17:51]** improving.

**[17:51]** improving. Another example just to put this alive a

**[17:54]** Another example just to put this alive a

**[17:54]** Another example just to put this alive a little bit as mentioned like this is

**[17:56]** little bit as mentioned like this is

**[17:56]** little bit as mentioned like this is about getting a lot of things um right

**[17:59]** about getting a lot of things um right

**[17:59]** about getting a lot of things um right and it's each one of these individually


### [18:00 - 19:00]

**[18:01]** and it's each one of these individually

**[18:01]** and it's each one of these individually may not seem like it's the biggest deal

**[18:04]** may not seem like it's the biggest deal

**[18:04]** may not seem like it's the biggest deal uh but put together they really make a

**[18:06]** uh but put together they really make a

**[18:06]** uh but put together they really make a make a huge difference like this is for

**[18:09]** make a huge difference like this is for

**[18:09]** make a huge difference like this is for this is some of the top uh interventions

**[18:11]** this is some of the top uh interventions

**[18:11]** this is some of the top uh interventions that another client had to go through

**[18:14]** that another client had to go through

**[18:14]** that another client had to go through for them it really helped having you

**[18:15]** for them it really helped having you

**[18:15]** for them it really helped having you know setting up code labs for example

**[18:18]** know setting up code labs for example

**[18:18]** know setting up code labs for example really you know instituting a new set of

**[18:19]** really you know instituting a new set of

**[18:20]** really you know instituting a new set of certifications that helped motivate and

**[18:21]** certifications that helped motivate and

**[18:21]** certifications that helped motivate and and drive people to to change what they

**[18:24]** and drive people to to change what they

**[18:24]** and drive people to to change what they do day dayto-day. And these these things

**[18:26]** do day dayto-day. And these these things

**[18:26]** do day dayto-day. And these these things really added up to the change they

**[18:29]** really added up to the change they

**[18:29]** really added up to the change they needed.

**[18:31]** needed.

**[18:31]** needed. >> But building a robust measurement system

**[18:33]** >> But building a robust measurement system

**[18:33]** >> But building a robust measurement system that prioritizes outcomes and not just

**[18:38]** adoption is important not just to monitor progress but also pinpoint

**[18:40]** monitor progress but also pinpoint

**[18:40]** monitor progress but also pinpoint issues and course correct quickly. So

**[18:43]** issues and course correct quickly. So

**[18:43]** issues and course correct quickly. So one surprising result from the survey

**[18:45]** one surprising result from the survey

**[18:45]** one surprising result from the survey was that these enterprises that were

**[18:47]** was that these enterprises that were

**[18:47]** was that these enterprises that were bottom performers were not even

**[18:49]** bottom performers were not even

**[18:49]** bottom performers were not even measuring speed and only 10% were

**[18:50]** measuring speed and only 10% were measuring productivity.

**[18:53]** measuring productivity.

**[18:53]** measuring productivity. But our goal is to make our clients top

**[18:54]** But our goal is to make our clients top

**[18:54]** But our goal is to make our clients top performing organizations. So we've

**[18:56]** performing organizations. So we've

**[18:56]** performing organizations. So we've worked with them to create a holistic

**[18:58]** worked with them to create a holistic

**[18:58]** worked with them to create a holistic measurement system that captures impact


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:01]** measurement system that captures impact

**[19:02]** measurement system that captures impact all the way down to inputs. So for

**[19:04]** all the way down to inputs. So for

**[19:04]** all the way down to inputs. So for inputs this would include the investment

**[19:06]** inputs this would include the investment

**[19:06]** inputs this would include the investment into coding tools and other AI tools but

**[19:09]** into coding tools and other AI tools but

**[19:09]** into coding tools and other AI tools but also the time and resources in

**[19:11]** also the time and resources in

**[19:11]** also the time and resources in upskilling and change management. These

**[19:14]** upskilling and change management. These

**[19:14]** upskilling and change management. These inputs would lead to direct outputs but

**[19:16]** inputs would lead to direct outputs but

**[19:16]** inputs would lead to direct outputs but a lot of organizations are just focusing

**[19:18]** a lot of organizations are just focusing

**[19:18]** a lot of organizations are just focusing on how the increased breath and depth of

**[19:20]** on how the increased breath and depth of

**[19:20]** on how the increased breath and depth of adoption with of AI tools is leading to

**[19:23]** adoption with of AI tools is leading to

**[19:23]** adoption with of AI tools is leading to increased velocity and capac capacity

**[19:25]** increased velocity and capac capacity

**[19:25]** increased velocity and capac capacity increase. However, it's also important

**[19:27]** increase. However, it's also important

**[19:27]** increase. However, it's also important to understand how developers have uh

**[19:31]** to understand how developers have uh

**[19:31]** to understand how developers have uh different NPS scores and if they're

**[19:33]** different NPS scores and if they're

**[19:33]** different NPS scores and if they're enjoying their craft more um rather than

**[19:35]** enjoying their craft more um rather than

**[19:35]** enjoying their craft more um rather than feeling more frustrated. And it's also

**[19:37]** feeling more frustrated. And it's also

**[19:51]** resolve priority bugs.

**[19:51]** resolve priority bugs. Now if we look at economic outcomes

**[19:53]** Now if we look at economic outcomes

**[19:53]** Now if we look at economic outcomes which is priority for um the seauite

**[19:55]** which is priority for um the seauite executives they look into what is the

**[19:58]** executives they look into what is the

**[19:58]** executives they look into what is the time to revenue target what is the


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:00]** time to revenue target what is the

**[20:00]** time to revenue target what is the increased price differential for higher

**[20:02]** increased price differential for higher

**[20:02]** increased price differential for higher quality features or expanding the number

**[20:04]** quality features or expanding the number

**[20:04]** quality features or expanding the number of customers to meet the feature demand

**[20:06]** of customers to meet the feature demand

**[20:06]** of customers to meet the feature demand and also what is the cost reduction per

**[20:12]** pod for reduced human labor in aggregate. Having these larger economic

**[20:15]** aggregate. Having these larger economic

**[20:15]** aggregate. Having these larger economic outcomes can also lead um to for

**[20:18]** outcomes can also lead um to for

**[20:18]** outcomes can also lead um to for organizations to understand how there is

**[20:20]** organizations to understand how there is

**[20:20]** organizations to understand how there is an increased reinvestment in green field

**[20:22]** an increased reinvestment in green field

**[20:22]** an increased reinvestment in green field and brownfield development. But as these

**[20:25]** and brownfield development. But as these

**[20:25]** and brownfield development. But as these tools evolve, the proxies for these

**[20:27]** tools evolve, the proxies for these

**[20:27]** tools evolve, the proxies for these metrics will also evolve. But hopefully

**[20:29]** metrics will also evolve. But hopefully

**[20:29]** metrics will also evolve. But hopefully this provides a MECI framework as an

**[20:32]** this provides a MECI framework as an

**[20:32]** this provides a MECI framework as an initial starting point.

**[20:34]** initial starting point.

**[20:34]** initial starting point. So what's next? The future of course is

**[20:36]** So what's next? The future of course is

**[20:36]** So what's next? The future of course is difficult to predict, let alone in the

**[20:38]** difficult to predict, let alone in the

**[20:38]** difficult to predict, let alone in the next 5 years. But we hope that with our

**[20:41]** next 5 years. But we hope that with our

**[20:41]** next 5 years. But we hope that with our vision of a new software development

**[20:43]** vision of a new software development

**[20:43]** vision of a new software development model, even as agents increase in their

**[20:46]** model, even as agents increase in their

**[20:46]** model, even as agents increase in their intelligence and humans become more

**[20:48]** intelligence and humans become more

**[20:48]** intelligence and humans become more fluent in AI, that this model still

**[20:50]** fluent in AI, that this model still

**[20:50]** fluent in AI, that this model still stands. So hopefully this model that

**[20:53]** stands. So hopefully this model that

**[20:53]** stands. So hopefully this model that includes um shorter sprints, smaller

**[20:56]** includes um shorter sprints, smaller

**[20:56]** includes um shorter sprints, smaller teams, but large u smaller but larger

**[20:59]** teams, but large u smaller but larger

**[20:59]** teams, but large u smaller but larger number of teams will set enterprises up


### [21:00 - 22:00]

**[21:01]** number of teams will set enterprises up

**[21:01]** number of teams will set enterprises up for success in the long term.

**[21:04]** for success in the long term.
