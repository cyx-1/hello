**[01:00]** >> [laughter]

**[01:00]** >> [laughter] >> Come on. Come on.

**[01:03]** >> Come on. Come on.

**[01:03]** >> Come on. Come on. [applause]

**[01:04]** [applause]

**[01:04]** [applause] Um, so I'm supposed to talk uh today

**[01:07]** Um, so I'm supposed to talk uh today

**[01:07]** Um, so I'm supposed to talk uh today about uh how to build an a playbook for

**[01:10]** about uh how to build an a playbook for

**[01:10]** about uh how to build an a playbook for how to build an AI native company. And

**[01:13]** how to build an AI native company. And

**[01:13]** how to build an AI native company. And um I actually don't have one

**[01:15]** um I actually don't have one

**[01:15]** um I actually don't have one unfortunately. Um

**[01:18]** unfortunately. Um

**[01:18]** unfortunately. Um and that's because I think the playbook

**[01:21]** and that's because I think the playbook

**[01:21]** and that's because I think the playbook is actually being invented right now. So

**[01:23]** is actually being invented right now. So

**[01:23]** is actually being invented right now. So we're doing it at the company that I run

**[01:25]** we're doing it at the company that I run

**[01:25]** we're doing it at the company that I run every but all of you are doing it here

**[01:27]** every but all of you are doing it here

**[01:27]** every but all of you are doing it here today as well and and and so I don't

**[01:30]** today as well and and and so I don't

**[01:30]** today as well and and and so I don't want to do this talk from the

**[01:32]** want to do this talk from the

**[01:32]** want to do this talk from the perspective of I have all the answers

**[01:33]** perspective of I have all the answers

**[01:33]** perspective of I have all the answers and I'm going to tell you the framework

**[01:34]** and I'm going to tell you the framework

**[01:34]** and I'm going to tell you the framework and the playbook and all that kind of

**[01:35]** and the playbook and all that kind of

**[01:35]** and the playbook and all that kind of stuff. Um but um I do think it is

**[01:40]** stuff. Um but um I do think it is

**[01:40]** stuff. Um but um I do think it is helpful when we're in this beginning

**[01:43]** helpful when we're in this beginning

**[01:43]** helpful when we're in this beginning stage of

**[01:46]** stage of

**[01:46]** stage of uh learning how to use AI to do

**[01:49]** uh learning how to use AI to do

**[01:49]** uh learning how to use AI to do engineering to build companies uh to

**[01:52]** engineering to build companies uh to

**[01:52]** engineering to build companies uh to share like the the personal experiences

**[01:53]** share like the the personal experiences

**[01:54]** share like the the personal experiences that we're having inside of our

**[01:55]** that we're having inside of our

**[01:55]** that we're having inside of our companies um and uh and sort of

**[01:58]** companies um and uh and sort of

**[01:58]** companies um and uh and sort of collaboratively figure out the playbook


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** collaboratively figure out the playbook

**[02:00]** collaboratively figure out the playbook together. So I think the best that I can

**[02:02]** together. So I think the best that I can

**[02:02]** together. So I think the best that I can offer is really just sort of dispatches

**[02:04]** offer is really just sort of dispatches

**[02:04]** offer is really just sort of dispatches from the future. Uh notes on what I've

**[02:05]** from the future. Uh notes on what I've

**[02:06]** from the future. Uh notes on what I've figured out um and the work that we've

**[02:07]** figured out um and the work that we've

**[02:07]** figured out um and the work that we've done inside of every um and I think the

**[02:11]** done inside of every um and I think the

**[02:11]** done inside of every um and I think the the first big thing the first the first

**[02:12]** the first big thing the first the first

**[02:12]** the first big thing the first the first big thing I really noticed is that there

**[02:15]** big thing I really noticed is that there

**[02:15]** big thing I really noticed is that there is definitely a huge there's a 10x

**[02:18]** is definitely a huge there's a 10x

**[02:18]** is definitely a huge there's a 10x difference between an org where 90% of

**[02:20]** difference between an org where 90% of

**[02:20]** difference between an org where 90% of the engineers are using AI versus an org

**[02:23]** the engineers are using AI versus an org

**[02:23]** the engineers are using AI versus an org where 100% of the engineers are using

**[02:24]** where 100% of the engineers are using

**[02:24]** where 100% of the engineers are using AI. It's it's it's totally different.

**[02:27]** AI. It's it's it's totally different.

**[02:27]** AI. It's it's it's totally different. Um, I think the I think the big thing is

**[02:29]** Um, I think the I think the big thing is

**[02:29]** Um, I think the I think the big thing is if even 10% of your company is

**[02:34]** if even 10% of your company is

**[02:34]** if even 10% of your company is uh is using a more traditional

**[02:35]** uh is using a more traditional

**[02:35]** uh is using a more traditional engineering method, you you sort of have

**[02:37]** engineering method, you you sort of have

**[02:37]** engineering method, you you sort of have to lean all the way back over into that

**[02:39]** to lean all the way back over into that

**[02:39]** to lean all the way back over into that world. Um, and so it it prevents you

**[02:42]** world. Um, and so it it prevents you

**[02:42]** world. Um, and so it it prevents you from doing some of the things that you

**[02:43]** from doing some of the things that you

**[02:43]** from doing some of the things that you might do if everyone was uh not typing

**[02:46]** might do if everyone was uh not typing

**[02:46]** might do if everyone was uh not typing into a code editor all the time. Um,

**[02:50]** into a code editor all the time. Um,

**[02:50]** into a code editor all the time. Um, and I know this because this is what we

**[02:53]** and I know this because this is what we

**[02:53]** and I know this because this is what we do at every um, which is the company

**[02:55]** do at every um, which is the company

**[02:55]** do at every um, which is the company that I run. And it has totally

**[02:58]** that I run. And it has totally

**[02:58]** that I run. And it has totally transformed what we are able to do as a


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** transformed what we are able to do as a

**[03:01]** transformed what we are able to do as a small company. Um, and so I think of us

**[03:03]** small company. Um, and so I think of us

**[03:03]** small company. Um, and so I think of us as like a little bit of a lab for what's

**[03:05]** as like a little bit of a lab for what's

**[03:05]** as like a little bit of a lab for what's possible that I I'm excited to share

**[03:07]** possible that I I'm excited to share

**[03:07]** possible that I I'm excited to share with you. So for people who don't know,

**[03:10]** with you. So for people who don't know,

**[03:10]** with you. So for people who don't know, I run every um, inside of every we have

**[03:15]** I run every um, inside of every we have

**[03:15]** I run every um, inside of every we have six business units. We have four

**[03:18]** six business units. We have four

**[03:18]** six business units. We have four software products. We run four software

**[03:20]** software products. We run four software

**[03:20]** software products. We run four software products with just 15 people, which is

**[03:22]** products with just 15 people, which is

**[03:22]** products with just 15 people, which is kind of crazy. Um, and these software

**[03:25]** kind of crazy. Um, and these software

**[03:25]** kind of crazy. Um, and these software products are not toys. We've grown at

**[03:27]** products are not toys. We've grown at

**[03:27]** products are not toys. We've grown at every we've grown MR by double digits

**[03:29]** every we've grown MR by double digits

**[03:29]** every we've grown MR by double digits every month for the last 6 months. We

**[03:32]** every month for the last 6 months. We

**[03:32]** every month for the last 6 months. We have over 7,000 paying subscribers and

**[03:34]** have over 7,000 paying subscribers and

**[03:34]** have over 7,000 paying subscribers and over 100,000 free subscribers. Um, and

**[03:37]** over 100,000 free subscribers. Um, and

**[03:37]** over 100,000 free subscribers. Um, and we've done this in a very capital-like

**[03:39]** we've done this in a very capital-like

**[03:39]** we've done this in a very capital-like way. We've only raised about a million

**[03:40]** way. We've only raised about a million

**[03:40]** way. We've only raised about a million dollars in total. Um and very

**[03:42]** dollars in total. Um and very

**[03:42]** dollars in total. Um and very importantly for for this audience and

**[03:44]** importantly for for this audience and

**[03:44]** importantly for for this audience and for this discussion um 99% of our code

**[03:48]** for this discussion um 99% of our code

**[03:48]** for this discussion um 99% of our code is written by AI agents. Uh no one is

**[03:51]** is written by AI agents. Uh no one is

**[03:51]** is written by AI agents. Uh no one is handwriting code. No one is writing code

**[03:53]** handwriting code. No one is writing code

**[03:53]** handwriting code. No one is writing code at all. Um it's all done with cloud

**[03:56]** at all. Um it's all done with cloud

**[03:56]** at all. Um it's all done with cloud code, codec, Droid, what have you. Um uh


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** code, codec, Droid, what have you. Um uh

**[04:01]** code, codec, Droid, what have you. Um uh coding agent of your of your choice.

**[04:04]** coding agent of your of your choice.

**[04:04]** coding agent of your of your choice. Um, and also really importantly for the

**[04:07]** Um, and also really importantly for the

**[04:07]** Um, and also really importantly for the size of team we are, each one of our

**[04:10]** size of team we are, each one of our

**[04:10]** size of team we are, each one of our apps is built by a single developer,

**[04:12]** apps is built by a single developer,

**[04:12]** apps is built by a single developer, which is crazy. And these are not like

**[04:15]** which is crazy. And these are not like

**[04:15]** which is crazy. And these are not like uh little apps. Uh, here here's an

**[04:17]** uh little apps. Uh, here here's an

**[04:17]** uh little apps. Uh, here here's an example. This is Kora, which is a um AI

**[04:21]** example. This is Kora, which is a um AI

**[04:21]** example. This is Kora, which is a um AI email management app. Um, it's sort of

**[04:23]** email management app. Um, it's sort of

**[04:23]** email management app. Um, it's sort of an it's it is it's an assistant for your

**[04:25]** an it's it is it's an assistant for your

**[04:25]** an it's it is it's an assistant for your email. It on on the left over here, it

**[04:28]** email. It on on the left over here, it

**[04:28]** email. It on on the left over here, it summarizes all of your all of your

**[04:29]** summarizes all of your all of your

**[04:29]** summarizes all of your all of your emails that come in. So, you can kind of

**[04:30]** emails that come in. So, you can kind of

**[04:30]** emails that come in. So, you can kind of read your email that way. This is what

**[04:31]** read your email that way. This is what

**[04:31]** read your email that way. This is what my inbox looks like. on the right is a

**[04:34]** my inbox looks like. on the right is a

**[04:34]** my inbox looks like. on the right is a um email assistant that you can ask

**[04:36]** um email assistant that you can ask

**[04:36]** um email assistant that you can ask questions like I asked where's when's my

**[04:38]** questions like I asked where's when's my

**[04:38]** questions like I asked where's when's my AI engineer talk um today and it gave me

**[04:41]** AI engineer talk um today and it gave me

**[04:41]** AI engineer talk um today and it gave me just gave me the answer um and this is

**[04:43]** just gave me the answer um and this is

**[04:43]** just gave me the answer um and this is built primarily by one engineer um that

**[04:47]** built primarily by one engineer um that

**[04:47]** built primarily by one engineer um that he's got one or two contractors that

**[04:49]** he's got one or two contractors that

**[04:49]** he's got one or two contractors that have helped in in certain ways but like

**[04:50]** have helped in in certain ways but like

**[04:50]** have helped in in certain ways but like almost all of this is built by one guy

**[04:53]** almost all of this is built by one guy

**[04:53]** almost all of this is built by one guy same thing for um

**[04:56]** same thing for um

**[04:56]** same thing for um uh this app which is another one that we

**[04:58]** uh this app which is another one that we

**[04:58]** uh this app which is another one that we we make called monologue which is a


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** we make called monologue which is a

**[05:00]** we make called monologue which is a speechtoext app It's sort of like Super

**[05:03]** speechtoext app It's sort of like Super

**[05:03]** speechtoext app It's sort of like Super Whisper or Whisper Flow if you know of

**[05:05]** Whisper or Whisper Flow if you know of

**[05:05]** Whisper or Whisper Flow if you know of those. Um, again, one guy, thousands of

**[05:09]** those. Um, again, one guy, thousands of

**[05:09]** those. Um, again, one guy, thousands of users. Um, I I love it. It's a it's a

**[05:11]** users. Um, I I love it. It's a it's a

**[05:11]** users. Um, I I love it. It's a it's a it's just a beautifully done app and

**[05:13]** it's just a beautifully done app and

**[05:13]** it's just a beautifully done app and it's not it's not simple. It's

**[05:15]** it's not it's not simple. It's

**[05:15]** it's not it's not simple. It's complicated. There's a lot of stuff to

**[05:17]** complicated. There's a lot of stuff to

**[05:17]** complicated. There's a lot of stuff to it. Same thing for this app called

**[05:19]** it. Same thing for this app called

**[05:19]** it. Same thing for this app called Spiral. You can see there's it's it's

**[05:22]** Spiral. You can see there's it's it's

**[05:22]** Spiral. You can see there's it's it's big. Um, and again, one engineer.

**[05:27]** big. Um, and again, one engineer.

**[05:27]** big. Um, and again, one engineer. So, obviously, this would not have been

**[05:28]** So, obviously, this would not have been

**[05:28]** So, obviously, this would not have been possible um a few years ago. it would

**[05:31]** possible um a few years ago. it would

**[05:31]** possible um a few years ago. it would not have been possible even a year ago.

**[05:33]** not have been possible even a year ago.

**[05:33]** not have been possible even a year ago. And I think the big change that happened

**[05:35]** And I think the big change that happened

**[05:35]** And I think the big change that happened that we're all starting to catch up to

**[05:37]** that we're all starting to catch up to

**[05:37]** that we're all starting to catch up to is um it started with cloud code this

**[05:40]** is um it started with cloud code this

**[05:40]** is um it started with cloud code this sort of like terminal UI that gets rid

**[05:41]** sort of like terminal UI that gets rid

**[05:41]** sort of like terminal UI that gets rid of the code editor really push pushed us

**[05:44]** of the code editor really push pushed us

**[05:44]** of the code editor really push pushed us into a place where um we are delegating

**[05:48]** into a place where um we are delegating

**[05:48]** into a place where um we are delegating tasks to these agents. We are and and

**[05:51]** tasks to these agents. We are and and

**[05:51]** tasks to these agents. We are and and that allows us to uh work in parallel

**[05:54]** that allows us to uh work in parallel

**[05:54]** that allows us to uh work in parallel and do much more than we would have

**[05:56]** and do much more than we would have

**[05:56]** and do much more than we would have ordinarily. Um,

**[05:59]** ordinarily. Um,

**[05:59]** ordinarily. Um, so some of the things that some of the


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** so some of the things that some of the

**[06:01]** so some of the things that some of the things that I've noticed that we can do

**[06:02]** things that I've noticed that we can do

**[06:02]** things that I've noticed that we can do that I I assume people in this room are

**[06:04]** that I I assume people in this room are

**[06:04]** that I I assume people in this room are starting to see but

**[06:06]** starting to see but

**[06:06]** starting to see but >> [snorts]

**[06:06]** >> [snorts]

**[06:06]** >> [snorts] >> um I think is sort of important to put

**[06:08]** >> um I think is sort of important to put

**[06:08]** >> um I think is sort of important to put put our finger on is uh the reason we

**[06:11]** put our finger on is uh the reason we

**[06:11]** put our finger on is uh the reason we can go much faster is we can work on

**[06:13]** can go much faster is we can work on

**[06:13]** can go much faster is we can work on multiple multiple features and bugs in

**[06:14]** multiple multiple features and bugs in

**[06:14]** multiple multiple features and bugs in parallel. And I think that there's a um

**[06:17]** parallel. And I think that there's a um

**[06:17]** parallel. And I think that there's a um there's like a little bit of a meme of

**[06:19]** there's like a little bit of a meme of

**[06:19]** there's like a little bit of a meme of the vibe coder on Twitter that is oh

**[06:22]** the vibe coder on Twitter that is oh

**[06:22]** the vibe coder on Twitter that is oh like they they have um they have four

**[06:25]** like they they have um they have four

**[06:25]** like they they have um they have four panes open but they're not actually

**[06:26]** panes open but they're not actually

**[06:26]** panes open but they're not actually doing any work. And I actually you can

**[06:29]** doing any work. And I actually you can

**[06:29]** doing any work. And I actually you can do it that way. And I think there are

**[06:31]** do it that way. And I think there are

**[06:31]** do it that way. And I think there are also definitely engineers and I know

**[06:33]** also definitely engineers and I know

**[06:33]** also definitely engineers and I know that they are because they work at every

**[06:35]** that they are because they work at every

**[06:35]** that they are because they work at every that are productively using four panes

**[06:38]** that are productively using four panes

**[06:38]** that are productively using four panes of agents at the same time. Um, and

**[06:41]** of agents at the same time. Um, and

**[06:41]** of agents at the same time. Um, and that's that's crazy and that that

**[06:43]** that's that's crazy and that that

**[06:43]** that's that's crazy and that that contributes a lot to the um ability for

**[06:46]** contributes a lot to the um ability for

**[06:46]** contributes a lot to the um ability for a single developer to build and run a

**[06:48]** a single developer to build and run a

**[06:48]** a single developer to build and run a production application. Um, another like

**[06:51]** production application. Um, another like

**[06:51]** production application. Um, another like really important thing about this, a

**[06:53]** really important thing about this, a

**[06:53]** really important thing about this, a really big um, unlock is because code is

**[06:56]** really big um, unlock is because code is

**[06:56]** really big um, unlock is because code is cheap, you can prototype risky ideas and

**[06:59]** cheap, you can prototype risky ideas and

**[06:59]** cheap, you can prototype risky ideas and that allows you to do more experiments


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** that allows you to do more experiments

**[07:00]** that allows you to do more experiments than you would ordinarily. And that lets

**[07:02]** than you would ordinarily. And that lets

**[07:02]** than you would ordinarily. And that lets you make way more progress because the

**[07:06]** you make way more progress because the

**[07:06]** you make way more progress because the starting energy to try something is so

**[07:07]** starting energy to try something is so

**[07:08]** starting energy to try something is so much lower because you just like say,

**[07:09]** much lower because you just like say,

**[07:09]** much lower because you just like say, "Oh, go do this. go do some research on

**[07:10]** "Oh, go do this. go do some research on

**[07:10]** "Oh, go do this. go do some research on this like big refactor I might want to

**[07:12]** this like big refactor I might want to

**[07:12]** this like big refactor I might want to do and then you go off and do something

**[07:13]** do and then you go off and do something

**[07:13]** do and then you go off and do something else. And that's a really big deal.

**[07:22]** Um, and another really interesting thing

**[07:22]** Um, and another really interesting thing that I love about this stuff that I'

**[07:24]** that I love about this stuff that I'

**[07:24]** that I love about this stuff that I' I've noticed in inside of inside of our

**[07:26]** I've noticed in inside of inside of our

**[07:26]** I've noticed in inside of inside of our organization is we move we're moving a

**[07:29]** organization is we move we're moving a

**[07:29]** organization is we move we're moving a bit more toward a demo culture where um

**[07:32]** bit more toward a demo culture where um

**[07:32]** bit more toward a demo culture where um instead of you know previously if you

**[07:35]** instead of you know previously if you

**[07:35]** instead of you know previously if you wanted to make something you'd have to

**[07:36]** wanted to make something you'd have to

**[07:36]** wanted to make something you'd have to be like maybe write a memo or do a do a

**[07:38]** be like maybe write a memo or do a do a

**[07:38]** be like maybe write a memo or do a do a deck or um or you know convince a bunch

**[07:41]** deck or um or you know convince a bunch

**[07:41]** deck or um or you know convince a bunch of people that it was a good idea to

**[07:42]** of people that it was a good idea to

**[07:42]** of people that it was a good idea to spend time on because you can vibe code

**[07:45]** spend time on because you can vibe code

**[07:45]** spend time on because you can vibe code something uh in a couple hours that sort

**[07:48]** something uh in a couple hours that sort

**[07:48]** something uh in a couple hours that sort of shows the thing that you're uh that

**[07:51]** of shows the thing that you're uh that

**[07:51]** of shows the thing that you're uh that you want to make. It it allows you to

**[07:53]** you want to make. It it allows you to

**[07:53]** you want to make. It it allows you to show everybody and uh I think that being

**[07:58]** a being a sort of de democulture allows

**[07:58]** a being a sort of de democulture allows you to do weirder things that you only


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** you to do weirder things that you only

**[08:01]** you to do weirder things that you only get if you can feel it. Um which is I

**[08:54]** compounding engineering

**[08:54]** compounding engineering Um, and the way that I talk about

**[08:55]** Um, and the way that I talk about

**[08:55]** Um, and the way that I talk about compounding engineering is in

**[08:57]** compounding engineering is in

**[08:57]** compounding engineering is in traditional engineering, each feature


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** traditional engineering, each feature

**[09:00]** traditional engineering, each feature makes the next feature harder to build.

**[09:03]** makes the next feature harder to build.

**[09:03]** makes the next feature harder to build. In compounding engineering, your goal is

**[09:05]** In compounding engineering, your goal is

**[09:05]** In compounding engineering, your goal is to make sure that each feature makes the

**[09:07]** to make sure that each feature makes the

**[09:07]** to make sure that each feature makes the next feature easier to build. Um, and we

**[09:11]** next feature easier to build. Um, and we

**[09:11]** next feature easier to build. Um, and we do that in this loop.

**[09:14]** do that in this loop.

**[09:14]** do that in this loop. Um, the loop has four steps. The first

**[09:16]** Um, the loop has four steps. The first

**[09:16]** Um, the loop has four steps. The first one is plan. And if you're you've been

**[09:18]** one is plan. And if you're you've been

**[09:18]** one is plan. And if you're you've been here today, you've been paying

**[09:19]** here today, you've been paying

**[09:19]** here today, you've been paying attention, you know how important it is

**[09:20]** attention, you know how important it is

**[09:20]** attention, you know how important it is when you're working with agents to make

**[09:21]** when you're working with agents to make

**[09:22]** when you're working with agents to make a really really detailed plan. So I

**[09:23]** a really really detailed plan. So I

**[09:23]** a really really detailed plan. So I think everyone is doing that. Second

**[09:25]** think everyone is doing that. Second

**[09:25]** think everyone is doing that. Second step is delegate. Just like go tell the

**[09:27]** step is delegate. Just like go tell the

**[09:27]** step is delegate. Just like go tell the agent to do it. Everyone's doing that

**[09:29]** agent to do it. Everyone's doing that

**[09:29]** agent to do it. Everyone's doing that too. Third step is assess. And we have

**[09:31]** too. Third step is assess. And we have

**[09:32]** too. Third step is assess. And we have tons and tons of ways to um assess

**[09:34]** tons and tons of ways to um assess

**[09:34]** tons and tons of ways to um assess whether the work that the agent did is

**[09:35]** whether the work that the agent did is

**[09:35]** whether the work that the agent did is any good. There's tests, there's trying

**[09:37]** any good. There's tests, there's trying

**[09:37]** any good. There's tests, there's trying it, there's having the agent uh figure

**[09:39]** it, there's having the agent uh figure

**[09:40]** it, there's having the agent uh figure it out. There's there's code review,

**[09:41]** it out. There's there's code review,

**[11:04]** Um, so the first thing that you notice

**[11:04]** Um, so the first thing that you notice if you sort of if you set up this

**[11:05]** if you sort of if you set up this

**[11:06]** if you sort of if you set up this process and you and you're like 100%

**[11:09]** bought in on something like compounding engineering um is that tacet code

**[11:12]** engineering um is that tacet code

**[11:12]** engineering um is that tacet code sharing becomes much easier. So uh we

**[11:16]** sharing becomes much easier. So uh we

**[11:16]** sharing becomes much easier. So uh we have we have multiple products at every

**[11:19]** have we have multiple products at every

**[11:19]** have we have multiple products at every a lot of a lot of products a lot of

**[11:20]** a lot of a lot of products a lot of

**[11:20]** a lot of a lot of products a lot of times need to implement similar things

**[11:22]** times need to implement similar things

**[11:22]** times need to implement similar things even if they use different technologies

**[11:23]** even if they use different technologies

**[11:23]** even if they use different technologies or imple implementing similar things

**[11:25]** or imple implementing similar things

**[11:25]** or imple implementing similar things like a team's feature or a certain type

**[11:27]** like a team's feature or a certain type

**[11:27]** like a team's feature or a certain type of ooth or whatever. Um

**[11:31]** of ooth or whatever. Um

**[11:31]** of ooth or whatever. Um previously in order to share code you'd

**[11:33]** previously in order to share code you'd

**[11:33]** previously in order to share code you'd have to like abstract out whatever you

**[11:34]** have to like abstract out whatever you

**[11:34]** have to like abstract out whatever you did into a library and then like allow

**[11:36]** did into a library and then like allow

**[11:36]** did into a library and then like allow someone else to download it and it it'd

**[11:37]** someone else to download it and it it'd

**[11:37]** someone else to download it and it it'd be hard to do or you'd have to talk

**[11:39]** be hard to do or you'd have to talk

**[11:39]** be hard to do or you'd have to talk about it. with agents. Um you can just

**[11:42]** about it. with agents. Um you can just

**[11:42]** about it. with agents. Um you can just point your cloud code instance at um the

**[11:45]** point your cloud code instance at um the

**[11:45]** point your cloud code instance at um the repo from the developer sitting next to

**[11:47]** repo from the developer sitting next to

**[11:47]** repo from the developer sitting next to you and learn the process that they went

**[11:49]** you and learn the process that they went

**[11:49]** you and learn the process that they went through to build the feature that they

**[11:50]** through to build the feature that they

**[11:50]** through to build the feature that they that you need to reimplement and

**[11:52]** that you need to reimplement and

**[11:52]** that you need to reimplement and reimplement it yourself in your own tech

**[11:55]** reimplement it yourself in your own tech

**[11:55]** reimplement it yourself in your own tech stack in your own framework and in your

**[11:56]** stack in your own framework and in your

**[11:56]** stack in your own framework and in your own way. Um, and that's really really

**[11:58]** own way. Um, and that's really really

**[11:58]** own way. Um, and that's really really cool to kind of have this the more


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:01]** cool to kind of have this the more

**[12:01]** cool to kind of have this the more developers you have working on different

**[12:02]** developers you have working on different

**[12:02]** developers you have working on different things inside of the org, the more you

**[12:04]** things inside of the org, the more you

**[12:04]** things inside of the org, the more you can um share without any extra cost

**[12:07]** can um share without any extra cost

**[12:07]** can um share without any extra cost because AI can just go read all the code

**[12:09]** because AI can just go read all the code

**[12:09]** because AI can just go read all the code and and um and use it. Um, another

**[12:13]** and and um and use it. Um, another

**[12:13]** and and um and use it. Um, another really cool thing that I've noticed is

**[12:15]** really cool thing that I've noticed is

**[12:15]** really cool thing that I've noticed is that new hires are productive on their

**[12:17]** that new hires are productive on their

**[12:17]** that new hires are productive on their first day because you've taken all of

**[12:19]** first day because you've taken all of

**[12:19]** first day because you've taken all of the things that you've learned about

**[12:20]** the things that you've learned about

**[12:20]** the things that you've learned about like, okay, how do I set up an

**[12:22]** like, okay, how do I set up an

**[12:22]** like, okay, how do I set up an environment and what does a good commit

**[12:24]** environment and what does a good commit

**[12:24]** environment and what does a good commit look like and all this kind of stuff and

**[12:27]** look like and all this kind of stuff and

**[12:27]** look like and all this kind of stuff and on the first day they have all that set

**[12:28]** on the first day they have all that set

**[12:28]** on the first day they have all that set up in their in their, you know, cloudmd

**[12:31]** up in their in their, you know, cloudmd

**[12:31]** up in their in their, you know, cloudmd files or their cursor files or uh codec

**[12:33]** files or their cursor files or uh codec

**[12:33]** files or their cursor files or uh codec files or whatever and um the agent just

**[12:38]** files or whatever and um the agent just

**[12:38]** files or whatever and um the agent just sets up their local environment and

**[12:40]** sets up their local environment and

**[12:40]** sets up their local environment and knows how to write a good PR. That's

**[12:43]** knows how to write a good PR. That's

**[12:43]** knows how to write a good PR. That's really cool. It also helps if you um

**[12:47]** really cool. It also helps if you um

**[12:48]** really cool. It also helps if you um want to hire like expert freelancers.

**[12:49]** want to hire like expert freelancers.

**[12:49]** want to hire like expert freelancers. Like there's some there's one guy

**[12:51]** Like there's some there's one guy

**[12:51]** Like there's some there's one guy there's one person who just is really

**[12:53]** there's one person who just is really

**[12:53]** there's one person who just is really good at this one specific thing. You can

**[12:54]** good at this one specific thing. You can

**[12:54]** good at this one specific thing. You can have them come in for a day and like do

**[12:56]** have them come in for a day and like do

**[12:56]** have them come in for a day and like do that thing. It's I think of it a little

**[12:58]** that thing. It's I think of it a little

**[12:58]** that thing. It's I think of it a little bit like um like a DJ or whatever can


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:02]** bit like um like a DJ or whatever can

**[13:02]** bit like um like a DJ or whatever can like go in on like a couple bars of a

**[13:03]** like go in on like a couple bars of a

**[13:03]** like go in on like a couple bars of a song. Like you can just sort of drop in

**[13:05]** song. Like you can just sort of drop in

**[13:05]** song. Like you can just sort of drop in and that's really helpful. it's it would

**[13:07]** and that's really helpful. it's it would

**[13:07]** and that's really helpful. it's it would ordinarily be like too hard to

**[13:08]** ordinarily be like too hard to

**[13:08]** ordinarily be like too hard to collaborate because the the startup cost

**[13:11]** collaborate because the the startup cost

**[13:11]** collaborate because the the startup cost is too high, but you can do that a lot

**[13:13]** is too high, but you can do that a lot

**[13:13]** is too high, but you can do that a lot better now.

**[13:16]** better now.

**[13:16]** better now. Um, another thing that I've noticed

**[13:17]** Um, another thing that I've noticed

**[13:18]** Um, another thing that I've noticed which is really cool too is um

**[13:20]** which is really cool too is um

**[13:20]** which is really cool too is um developers inside of every commit to um

**[13:23]** developers inside of every commit to um

**[13:23]** developers inside of every commit to um other products. So, uh you know we have

**[13:26]** other products. So, uh you know we have

**[13:26]** other products. So, uh you know we have four products that run internally.

**[13:28]** four products that run internally.

**[13:28]** four products that run internally. Everybody uses all the products. If

**[13:30]** Everybody uses all the products. If

**[13:30]** Everybody uses all the products. If someone uh runs into a bug or a paper

**[13:33]** someone uh runs into a bug or a paper

**[13:33]** someone uh runs into a bug or a paper cutter, like a little minor quality of

**[13:34]** cutter, like a little minor quality of

**[13:34]** cutter, like a little minor quality of life thing that they want, they will um

**[13:37]** life thing that they want, they will um

**[13:37]** life thing that they want, they will um often just um they will often just uh

**[13:42]** often just um they will often just uh

**[13:42]** often just um they will often just uh just submit a poll request for it to

**[13:44]** just submit a poll request for it to

**[13:44]** just submit a poll request for it to other GM of the app um because it's very

**[13:47]** other GM of the app um because it's very

**[13:47]** other GM of the app um because it's very easy for them to go download the repo

**[13:49]** easy for them to go download the repo

**[13:49]** easy for them to go download the repo and figure out uh or have really have

**[13:52]** and figure out uh or have really have

**[13:52]** and figure out uh or have really have Claude or Codeex figure out, okay, this

**[13:53]** Claude or Codeex figure out, okay, this

**[13:53]** Claude or Codeex figure out, okay, this is how we fix the bug or this is how we

**[13:55]** is how we fix the bug or this is how we

**[13:55]** is how we fix the bug or this is how we fix the paper cut. Um and that's really

**[13:58]** fix the paper cut. Um and that's really

**[13:58]** fix the paper cut. Um and that's really really cool because you have this


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** really cool because you have this

**[14:00]** really cool because you have this much um much easier way of collaborating

**[14:03]** much um much easier way of collaborating

**[14:03]** much um much easier way of collaborating across apps that I I think over the next

**[14:07]** across apps that I I think over the next

**[14:07]** across apps that I I think over the next couple years I imagine that you will

**[14:09]** couple years I imagine that you will

**[14:09]** couple years I imagine that you will also be able to let customers do this to

**[14:11]** also be able to let customers do this to

**[14:11]** also be able to let customers do this to some extent like if you run into a bug

**[14:13]** some extent like if you run into a bug

**[14:13]** some extent like if you run into a bug um this is you know speculative but if

**[14:16]** um this is you know speculative but if

**[14:16]** um this is you know speculative but if you run into a bug you can have your

**[14:17]** you run into a bug you can have your

**[14:17]** you run into a bug you can have your little agent fix it um and submit it as

**[14:19]** little agent fix it um and submit it as

**[14:19]** little agent fix it um and submit it as a pull request it's a weird open source

**[14:21]** a pull request it's a weird open source

**[14:21]** a pull request it's a weird open source thing but um yeah this is really really

**[14:24]** thing but um yeah this is really really

**[14:24]** thing but um yeah this is really really cool and and definitely is happening a

**[14:26]** cool and and definitely is happening a

**[14:26]** cool and and definitely is happening a lot inside of our company [snorts]

**[14:29]** lot inside of our company [snorts]

**[14:29]** lot inside of our company [snorts] Um, another really cool thing is um, we

**[14:33]** Um, another really cool thing is um, we

**[14:33]** Um, another really cool thing is um, we we have not this may get different as we

**[14:36]** we have not this may get different as we

**[14:36]** we have not this may get different as we as we scale, but um, we have not yet had

**[14:38]** as we scale, but um, we have not yet had

**[14:38]** as we scale, but um, we have not yet had to standardize onto a particular stack

**[14:40]** to standardize onto a particular stack

**[14:40]** to standardize onto a particular stack or language. We instead let everyone

**[14:42]** or language. We instead let everyone

**[14:42]** or language. We instead let everyone who's building different products like

**[14:44]** who's building different products like

**[14:44]** who's building different products like pick the thing that they like best and

**[14:46]** pick the thing that they like best and

**[14:46]** pick the thing that they like best and the reason is because it makes it AI

**[14:48]** the reason is because it makes it AI

**[14:48]** the reason is because it makes it AI makes it much easier to translate

**[14:49]** makes it much easier to translate

**[14:50]** makes it much easier to translate between them. Um, and it makes it much

**[14:52]** between them. Um, and it makes it much

**[14:52]** between them. Um, and it makes it much easier to to jump into any language and

**[14:55]** easier to to jump into any language and

**[14:55]** easier to to jump into any language and framework and environment and be

**[14:56]** framework and environment and be

**[14:56]** framework and environment and be productive. And so it we don't uh it's

**[14:59]** productive. And so it we don't uh it's


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** productive. And so it we don't uh it's easier for us to let people just do the

**[15:01]** easier for us to let people just do the

**[15:01]** easier for us to let people just do the thing that that they like and let AI

**[15:02]** thing that that they like and let AI

**[15:02]** thing that that they like and let AI kind of like handle the translation in

**[15:04]** kind of like handle the translation in

**[15:04]** kind of like handle the translation in between.

**[15:06]** between.

**[15:06]** between. Um and the last thing which is my

**[15:08]** Um and the last thing which is my

**[15:08]** Um and the last thing which is my favorite but like is also the horror I

**[15:09]** favorite but like is also the horror I

**[15:10]** favorite but like is also the horror I think of of some developers and to some

**[15:12]** think of of some developers and to some

**[15:12]** think of of some developers and to some degree maybe the horror of my team um is

**[15:14]** degree maybe the horror of my team um is

**[15:14]** degree maybe the horror of my team um is that managers can commit code. um if

**[15:17]** that managers can commit code. um if

**[15:17]** that managers can commit code. um if you're technical uh even the CEO and

**[15:21]** you're technical uh even the CEO and

**[15:21]** you're technical uh even the CEO and um for for me like I have no business

**[15:23]** um for for me like I have no business

**[15:23]** um for for me like I have no business committing code because we've got four

**[15:26]** committing code because we've got four

**[15:26]** committing code because we've got four products we've got 15 people we're

**[15:27]** products we've got 15 people we're

**[15:27]** products we've got 15 people we're growing really fast um I'm doing tons

**[15:29]** growing really fast um I'm doing tons

**[15:29]** growing really fast um I'm doing tons and tons of other things but I can and I

**[15:32]** and tons of other things but I can and I

**[15:32]** and tons of other things but I can and I I have like committed production code

**[15:33]** I have like committed production code

**[15:34]** I have like committed production code over the last couple months and the

**[15:35]** over the last couple months and the

**[15:35]** over the last couple months and the reason for that is AI allows um

**[15:39]** reason for that is AI allows um

**[15:39]** reason for that is AI allows um engineers to work with fractured

**[15:41]** engineers to work with fractured

**[15:41]** engineers to work with fractured attention so previously you might have

**[15:43]** attention so previously you might have

**[15:43]** attention so previously you might have needed like a 3 or 4 hour block of focus

**[15:45]** needed like a 3 or 4 hour block of focus

**[15:45]** needed like a 3 or 4 hour block of focus time in order to like get anything done.

**[15:47]** time in order to like get anything done.

**[15:48]** time in order to like get anything done. Um, but with cloud code, you can kind of

**[15:49]** Um, but with cloud code, you can kind of

**[15:49]** Um, but with cloud code, you can kind of like get out of meeting and say, "Hey,

**[15:52]** like get out of meeting and say, "Hey,

**[15:52]** like get out of meeting and say, "Hey, like I want you to investigate this

**[15:53]** like I want you to investigate this

**[15:53]** like I want you to investigate this bug." And then go do something else and

**[15:54]** bug." And then go do something else and

**[15:54]** bug." And then go do something else and then come back and you have like a a

**[15:56]** then come back and you have like a a

**[15:56]** then come back and you have like a a plan or like a um root cause fix and


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:00]** plan or like a um root cause fix and

**[16:00]** plan or like a um root cause fix and then you can submit a PR. And it's not

**[16:03]** then you can submit a PR. And it's not

**[16:03]** then you can submit a PR. And it's not easy. It's not magic, but it is actually

**[16:05]** easy. It's not magic, but it is actually

**[16:05]** easy. It's not magic, but it is actually possible. And I think that's a that's

**[16:07]** possible. And I think that's a that's

**[16:07]** possible. And I think that's a that's just a totally new way of thinking how

**[16:10]** just a totally new way of thinking how

**[16:10]** just a totally new way of thinking how thinking of thinking about how managers

**[16:13]** thinking of thinking about how managers

**[16:13]** thinking of thinking about how managers interact with the products that they

**[16:14]** interact with the products that they

**[16:14]** interact with the products that they make.

**[16:22]** So, um, just to just to summarize, um,

**[16:22]** So, um, just to just to summarize, um, there's a I really think there's a 10x

**[16:24]** there's a I really think there's a 10x

**[16:24]** there's a I really think there's a 10x difference in how things work when you

**[16:27]** difference in how things work when you

**[16:27]** difference in how things work when you hit 100% AI adoption.

**[16:29]** hit 100% AI adoption.

**[16:29]** hit 100% AI adoption. I think, um, from what we've seen, a

**[16:31]** I think, um, from what we've seen, a

**[16:31]** I think, um, from what we've seen, a single engineer should be able to build

**[16:33]** single engineer should be able to build

**[16:33]** single engineer should be able to build and maintain a complex production

**[16:35]** and maintain a complex production

**[16:35]** and maintain a complex production product. what we call compounding

**[16:37]** product. what we call compounding

**[16:37]** product. what we call compounding engineering, but I think what all of us

**[16:38]** engineering, but I think what all of us

**[16:38]** engineering, but I think what all of us are are sort of pointing to um is I I

**[16:43]** are are sort of pointing to um is I I

**[16:43]** are are sort of pointing to um is I I think really works to make each feature

**[16:44]** think really works to make each feature

**[16:44]** think really works to make each feature easier to build and then creates all of

**[16:47]** easier to build and then creates all of

**[16:47]** easier to build and then creates all of these sort of nonobvious second order

**[16:50]** these sort of nonobvious second order

**[16:50]** these sort of nonobvious second order effects that makes it easier for the

**[16:52]** effects that makes it easier for the

**[16:52]** effects that makes it easier for the entire organization to collaborate

**[16:53]** entire organization to collaborate

**[16:53]** entire organization to collaborate together.

**[16:54]** together.

**[16:54]** together. And very importantly, many people in San

**[16:57]** And very importantly, many people in San

**[16:57]** And very importantly, many people in San Francisco don't know this yet. Um so

**[16:59]** Francisco don't know this yet. Um so

**[16:59]** Francisco don't know this yet. Um so you're you're the first to hear it. Um
