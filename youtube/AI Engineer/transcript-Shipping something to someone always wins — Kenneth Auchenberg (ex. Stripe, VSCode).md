### [00:00 - 01:00]

**[00:17]** So I am here to talk about how building

**[00:17]** So I am here to talk about how building products is really about shipping

**[00:19]** products is really about shipping

**[00:19]** products is really about shipping something to someone always wins and

**[00:21]** something to someone always wins and

**[00:21]** something to someone always wins and that's kind of been been a fundamental

**[00:22]** that's kind of been been a fundamental

**[00:22]** that's kind of been been a fundamental product principle of mine. Um really

**[00:25]** product principle of mine. Um really

**[00:25]** product principle of mine. Um really short background I know the sign out

**[00:27]** short background I know the sign out

**[00:27]** short background I know the sign out there says say Microsoft that's a long

**[00:29]** there says say Microsoft that's a long

**[00:29]** there says say Microsoft that's a long time ago I was at Microsoft but I was at

**[00:31]** time ago I was at Microsoft but I was at

**[00:31]** time ago I was at Microsoft but I was at Microsoft as part of the early VS code

**[00:33]** Microsoft as part of the early VS code

**[00:33]** Microsoft as part of the early VS code team building that left in 19 we became

**[00:35]** team building that left in 19 we became

**[00:35]** team building that left in 19 we became the market leader spend some time at

**[00:37]** the market leader spend some time at

**[00:37]** the market leader spend some time at Stripe running our developer platform or

**[00:39]** Stripe running our developer platform or

**[00:39]** Stripe running our developer platform or building a big part of our developer

**[00:40]** building a big part of our developer

**[00:40]** building a big part of our developer platform and everything we we did for

**[00:42]** platform and everything we we did for

**[00:42]** platform and everything we we did for developers these days I'm a partner at

**[00:44]** developers these days I'm a partner at

**[00:44]** developers these days I'm a partner at Alico we are early stage venture fund in

**[00:46]** Alico we are early stage venture fund in

**[00:46]** Alico we are early stage venture fund in New York and this talk is really about

**[00:49]** New York and this talk is really about

**[00:49]** New York and this talk is really about applying my product builder lens uh of

**[00:52]** applying my product builder lens uh of

**[00:52]** applying my product builder lens uh of of of how I've been building products

**[00:53]** of of how I've been building products

**[00:54]** of of how I've been building products for the past many years and it's really

**[00:56]** for the past many years and it's really

**[00:56]** for the past many years and it's really about like how do we build great

**[00:58]** about like how do we build great

**[00:58]** about like how do we build great products in the context of AI and as I


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:03]** products in the context of AI and as I

**[01:03]** products in the context of AI and as I was putting the the the the talk

**[01:05]** was putting the the the the talk

**[01:05]** was putting the the the the talk together I was trying to like what is my

**[01:06]** together I was trying to like what is my

**[01:06]** together I was trying to like what is my overarching product principle and how

**[01:08]** overarching product principle and how

**[01:08]** overarching product principle and how you build great products and it really

**[01:11]** you build great products and it really

**[01:11]** you build great products and it really sums down to this it's really not about

**[01:14]** sums down to this it's really not about

**[01:14]** sums down to this it's really not about the number of big banks you do when

**[01:16]** the number of big banks you do when

**[01:16]** the number of big banks you do when you're building a product and I know

**[01:17]** you're building a product and I know

**[01:17]** you're building a product and I know like whether you're in a startup or you

**[01:20]** like whether you're in a startup or you

**[01:20]** like whether you're in a startup or you you are in a big company it's always

**[01:22]** you are in a big company it's always

**[01:22]** you are in a big company it's always about like you do the big ship at the

**[01:24]** about like you do the big ship at the

**[01:24]** about like you do the big ship at the big conference and then the product is

**[01:26]** big conference and then the product is

**[01:26]** big conference and then the product is out there. But the reality is that it's

**[01:28]** out there. But the reality is that it's

**[01:28]** out there. But the reality is that it's really about the number of iterations

**[01:30]** really about the number of iterations

**[01:30]** really about the number of iterations you crank at a problem and number of

**[01:32]** you crank at a problem and number of

**[01:32]** you crank at a problem and number of iterations that you get in when you're

**[01:34]** iterations that you get in when you're

**[01:34]** iterations that you get in when you're building your product. So in other

**[01:37]** building your product. So in other

**[01:37]** building your product. So in other words, it's all about like how you can

**[01:39]** words, it's all about like how you can

**[01:39]** words, it's all about like how you can enable rapid iterative loops and how you

**[01:42]** enable rapid iterative loops and how you

**[01:42]** enable rapid iterative loops and how you can get feedback from your real users

**[01:44]** can get feedback from your real users

**[01:44]** can get feedback from your real users and just get as many shots at the goal

**[01:46]** and just get as many shots at the goal

**[01:46]** and just get as many shots at the goal as possible. And I definitely think this

**[01:48]** as possible. And I definitely think this

**[01:48]** as possible. And I definitely think this is more relevant than ever in the age of

**[01:50]** is more relevant than ever in the age of

**[01:50]** is more relevant than ever in the age of AI. We had an AI engineer. We all talk

**[01:52]** AI. We had an AI engineer. We all talk

**[01:52]** AI. We had an AI engineer. We all talk about all the AI tools etc. But but

**[01:55]** about all the AI tools etc. But but

**[01:55]** about all the AI tools etc. But but really what does this mean in practice?

**[01:57]** really what does this mean in practice?

**[01:57]** really what does this mean in practice? What does it mean in practice to have a

**[01:59]** What does it mean in practice to have a

**[01:59]** What does it mean in practice to have a rapid iterative loop? And here I have an


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:02]** rapid iterative loop? And here I have an

**[02:02]** rapid iterative loop? And here I have an answer. It's really about skateboards.

**[02:04]** answer. It's really about skateboards.

**[02:04]** answer. It's really about skateboards. And like please please bear with me here

**[02:07]** And like please please bear with me here

**[02:07]** And like please please bear with me here with this metaphor. It's really about

**[02:10]** with this metaphor. It's really about

**[02:10]** with this metaphor. It's really about like asking the question, what's the

**[02:12]** like asking the question, what's the

**[02:12]** like asking the question, what's the best way to build a car? And there's

**[02:15]** best way to build a car? And there's

**[02:15]** best way to build a car? And there's like two ways you can build a car.

**[02:20]** like two ways you can build a car.

**[02:20]** like two ways you can build a car. the the tired way is that you start out

**[02:21]** the the tired way is that you start out

**[02:21]** the the tired way is that you start out building the wheels, then you build the

**[02:23]** building the wheels, then you build the

**[02:23]** building the wheels, then you build the chassis, then you add the engine, and

**[02:26]** chassis, then you add the engine, and

**[02:26]** chassis, then you add the engine, and then you have a car.

**[02:28]** then you have a car.

**[02:28]** then you have a car. But the reality is that if you do it

**[02:30]** But the reality is that if you do it

**[02:30]** But the reality is that if you do it this way, you don't have a viable

**[02:32]** this way, you don't have a viable

**[02:32]** this way, you don't have a viable product until the very end. You have no

**[02:35]** product until the very end. You have no

**[02:35]** product until the very end. You have no way to get feedback along the journey,

**[02:38]** way to get feedback along the journey,

**[02:38]** way to get feedback along the journey, you don't know if what you're doing with

**[02:40]** you don't know if what you're doing with

**[02:40]** you don't know if what you're doing with the incremental improvements that you're

**[02:42]** the incremental improvements that you're

**[02:42]** the incremental improvements that you're landing actually works because you don't

**[02:45]** landing actually works because you don't

**[02:45]** landing actually works because you don't have a functioning product until the

**[02:47]** have a functioning product until the

**[02:47]** have a functioning product until the very end.

**[02:49]** very end.

**[02:49]** very end. The the wired way is that you build a

**[02:51]** The the wired way is that you build a

**[02:51]** The the wired way is that you build a skateboard, then you make it a a

**[02:53]** skateboard, then you make it a a

**[02:54]** skateboard, then you make it a a scooter, then you make it a bike, then

**[02:56]** scooter, then you make it a bike, then

**[02:56]** scooter, then you make it a bike, then you add the engine, and then you have a

**[02:59]** you add the engine, and then you have a

**[02:59]** you add the engine, and then you have a car. And it's really about like the way


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:02]** car. And it's really about like the way

**[03:02]** car. And it's really about like the way you should be building your products in

**[03:03]** you should be building your products in

**[03:03]** you should be building your products in particular in the world of AI is that

**[03:05]** particular in the world of AI is that

**[03:05]** particular in the world of AI is that you need to have a continuously viable

**[03:07]** you need to have a continuously viable

**[03:07]** you need to have a continuously viable product that enables in this particular

**[03:09]** product that enables in this particular

**[03:09]** product that enables in this particular case a person to go from A to B and have

**[03:12]** case a person to go from A to B and have

**[03:12]** case a person to go from A to B and have a means of transport and then you evolve

**[03:14]** a means of transport and then you evolve

**[03:14]** a means of transport and then you evolve the product from there. And the key

**[03:17]** the product from there. And the key

**[03:17]** the product from there. And the key thing here when we think about feedback

**[03:18]** thing here when we think about feedback

**[03:18]** thing here when we think about feedback loop is that you have a continuous

**[03:20]** loop is that you have a continuous

**[03:20]** loop is that you have a continuous feedback loop that every time you land

**[03:22]** feedback loop that every time you land

**[03:22]** feedback loop that every time you land land an incremental change,

**[03:26]** land an incremental change,

**[03:26]** land an incremental change, you have real users getting transported

**[03:28]** you have real users getting transported

**[03:28]** you have real users getting transported and you're getting feedback from them.

**[03:30]** and you're getting feedback from them.

**[03:30]** and you're getting feedback from them. And really like my my experience like a

**[03:33]** And really like my my experience like a

**[03:33]** And really like my my experience like a continuously viable solution is many

**[03:36]** continuously viable solution is many

**[03:36]** continuously viable solution is many many orders of magnitude more valuable

**[03:39]** many orders of magnitude more valuable

**[03:39]** many orders of magnitude more valuable than a solution that only gives you a

**[03:41]** than a solution that only gives you a

**[03:41]** than a solution that only gives you a viable option in the end. And the reason

**[03:43]** viable option in the end. And the reason

**[03:43]** viable option in the end. And the reason for this is is that it gets you feedback

**[03:46]** for this is is that it gets you feedback

**[03:46]** for this is is that it gets you feedback along the way. You you avoid building in

**[03:48]** along the way. You you avoid building in

**[03:48]** along the way. You you avoid building in a vacuum, but you have feedback all all

**[03:51]** a vacuum, but you have feedback all all

**[03:51]** a vacuum, but you have feedback all all the way that when you're iterating and

**[03:53]** the way that when you're iterating and

**[03:53]** the way that when you're iterating and you most likely end up building

**[03:55]** you most likely end up building

**[03:55]** you most likely end up building something that's more meaningful and

**[03:56]** something that's more meaningful and

**[03:56]** something that's more meaningful and more relevant for your users. So in many

**[03:59]** more relevant for your users. So in many

**[03:59]** more relevant for your users. So in many ways this talk the short talk here is


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** ways this talk the short talk here is

**[04:01]** ways this talk the short talk here is really about like the Oda feedback loop

**[04:03]** really about like the Oda feedback loop

**[04:03]** really about like the Oda feedback loop and how we can accelerate this product

**[04:05]** and how we can accelerate this product

**[04:05]** and how we can accelerate this product feedback back loop to be as fast as

**[04:06]** feedback back loop to be as fast as

**[04:06]** feedback back loop to be as fast as possible. And you know when I was at

**[04:09]** possible. And you know when I was at

**[04:09]** possible. And you know when I was at Stripe when we were kicking off a a new

**[04:11]** Stripe when we were kicking off a a new

**[04:11]** Stripe when we were kicking off a a new project before we locked in any major

**[04:14]** project before we locked in any major

**[04:14]** project before we locked in any major considerations design decisions or

**[04:16]** considerations design decisions or

**[04:16]** considerations design decisions or really made made trap door decisions we

**[04:19]** really made made trap door decisions we

**[04:19]** really made made trap door decisions we made sure that there was a feedback loop

**[04:20]** made sure that there was a feedback loop

**[04:20]** made sure that there was a feedback loop in place. And what did that boil down

**[04:22]** in place. And what did that boil down

**[04:22]** in place. And what did that boil down to? Three things. We had real users that

**[04:25]** to? Three things. We had real users that

**[04:25]** to? Three things. We had real users that could see something. We had a way to get

**[04:27]** could see something. We had a way to get

**[04:27]** could see something. We had a way to get feedback from them. We could iterate and

**[04:30]** feedback from them. We could iterate and

**[04:30]** feedback from them. We could iterate and ship an improvement. And the goal was we

**[04:32]** ship an improvement. And the goal was we

**[04:32]** ship an improvement. And the goal was we could do this in less than a day.

**[04:34]** could do this in less than a day.

**[04:34]** could do this in less than a day. Ideally faster. If you ask Patrick, he

**[04:36]** Ideally faster. If you ask Patrick, he

**[04:36]** Ideally faster. If you ask Patrick, he would say hours.

**[04:39]** would say hours.

**[04:39]** would say hours. And and really like the reality is that

**[04:41]** And and really like the reality is that

**[04:41]** And and really like the reality is that if you cannot run your loop in a day,

**[04:44]** if you cannot run your loop in a day,

**[04:44]** if you cannot run your loop in a day, your process is broken. You have a

**[04:45]** your process is broken. You have a

**[04:45]** your process is broken. You have a problem. You cannot get feedback fast

**[04:48]** problem. You cannot get feedback fast

**[04:48]** problem. You cannot get feedback fast enough. And now I know this is easy to

**[04:51]** enough. And now I know this is easy to

**[04:51]** enough. And now I know this is easy to say and it gets exponentially harder as

**[04:53]** say and it gets exponentially harder as

**[04:53]** say and it gets exponentially harder as you're in a bigger company and you have

**[04:55]** you're in a bigger company and you have

**[04:55]** you're in a bigger company and you have a lot of complexity to manage, but this

**[04:57]** a lot of complexity to manage, but this

**[04:57]** a lot of complexity to manage, but this should be your goal. And I'm not saying

**[04:59]** should be your goal. And I'm not saying

**[04:59]** should be your goal. And I'm not saying that you need to ship every day, but the


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** that you need to ship every day, but the

**[05:01]** that you need to ship every day, but the key thing is that you need to be able to

**[05:03]** key thing is that you need to be able to

**[05:03]** key thing is that you need to be able to ship every day. You need to be able to

**[05:05]** ship every day. You need to be able to

**[05:05]** ship every day. You need to be able to get this feedback loop going as fast as

**[05:08]** get this feedback loop going as fast as

**[05:08]** get this feedback loop going as fast as possible.

**[05:10]** possible.

**[05:10]** possible. And this might sound very basic, but you

**[05:12]** And this might sound very basic, but you

**[05:12]** And this might sound very basic, but you need to be very specific about the

**[05:14]** need to be very specific about the

**[05:14]** need to be very specific about the customers you're building your feature,

**[05:15]** customers you're building your feature,

**[05:15]** customers you're building your feature, your product for. And I know like we all

**[05:18]** your product for. And I know like we all

**[05:18]** your product for. And I know like we all been running our personas. We all been

**[05:20]** been running our personas. We all been

**[05:20]** been running our personas. We all been like doing our our our UXR and user

**[05:23]** like doing our our our UXR and user

**[05:23]** like doing our our our UXR and user studies. And what I mean by being

**[05:25]** studies. And what I mean by being

**[05:25]** studies. And what I mean by being specific is that you should actually

**[05:27]** specific is that you should actually

**[05:27]** specific is that you should actually work with real people that you know,

**[05:29]** work with real people that you know,

**[05:29]** work with real people that you know, people that have a name, an email,

**[05:31]** people that have a name, an email,

**[05:31]** people that have a name, an email, somebody you can call. And if you don't

**[05:34]** somebody you can call. And if you don't

**[05:34]** somebody you can call. And if you don't know any real people, but you only have

**[05:36]** know any real people, but you only have

**[05:36]** know any real people, but you only have your UXR persona, you have a problem as

**[05:39]** your UXR persona, you have a problem as

**[05:39]** your UXR persona, you have a problem as well because you need to get to know

**[05:40]** well because you need to get to know

**[05:40]** well because you need to get to know your users.

**[05:43]** your users.

**[05:43]** your users. And the other thing is that you actually

**[05:45]** And the other thing is that you actually

**[05:45]** And the other thing is that you actually need to understand the real people

**[05:47]** need to understand the real people

**[05:47]** need to understand the real people you're working with, how they're solving

**[05:50]** you're working with, how they're solving

**[05:50]** you're working with, how they're solving the problem today. You need to be in

**[05:51]** the problem today. You need to be in

**[05:51]** the problem today. You need to be in their shoes and understand and build

**[05:53]** their shoes and understand and build

**[05:53]** their shoes and understand and build that empathy because it helps you

**[05:55]** that empathy because it helps you

**[05:55]** that empathy because it helps you navigate and actually build out

**[05:57]** navigate and actually build out

**[05:57]** navigate and actually build out hypothesis on how you're going to solve

**[05:58]** hypothesis on how you're going to solve

**[05:58]** hypothesis on how you're going to solve it and make it better.


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** it and make it better.

**[06:00]** it and make it better. And what we did at Stripe is that once

**[06:02]** And what we did at Stripe is that once

**[06:02]** And what we did at Stripe is that once we understood the problem, we had real

**[06:03]** we understood the problem, we had real

**[06:03]** we understood the problem, we had real people building uh building with we

**[06:06]** people building uh building with we

**[06:06]** people building uh building with we articulated our hypothesis, but we also

**[06:08]** articulated our hypothesis, but we also

**[06:08]** articulated our hypothesis, but we also wrote the PI for Q or the launch blog

**[06:11]** wrote the PI for Q or the launch blog

**[06:11]** wrote the PI for Q or the launch blog post and I do think this is one of the

**[06:14]** post and I do think this is one of the

**[06:14]** post and I do think this is one of the easiest steps to to miss and I think

**[06:18]** easiest steps to to miss and I think

**[06:18]** easiest steps to to miss and I think it's almost always a mistake not to sit

**[06:21]** it's almost always a mistake not to sit

**[06:21]** it's almost always a mistake not to sit down and write the launch blog post

**[06:23]** down and write the launch blog post

**[06:23]** down and write the launch blog post because you writing the PI FAQ or the

**[06:26]** because you writing the PI FAQ or the

**[06:26]** because you writing the PI FAQ or the press release or the blog post forces

**[06:28]** press release or the blog post forces

**[06:28]** press release or the blog post forces you to write something specific.

**[06:29]** you to write something specific.

**[06:29]** you to write something specific. specific to your audience is to sanity

**[06:32]** specific to your audience is to sanity

**[06:32]** specific to your audience is to sanity check things. You can communicate the

**[06:34]** check things. You can communicate the

**[06:34]** check things. You can communicate the product. You understand what's being

**[06:36]** product. You understand what's being

**[06:36]** product. You understand what's being built. You know how to shape it. You

**[06:38]** built. You know how to shape it. You

**[06:38]** built. You know how to shape it. You know how to like position it to your

**[06:39]** know how to like position it to your

**[06:39]** know how to like position it to your users. And you know when there was an

**[06:41]** users. And you know when there was an

**[06:41]** users. And you know when there was an API, we would drafting the API. It'd be

**[06:44]** API, we would drafting the API. It'd be

**[06:44]** API, we would drafting the API. It'd be a rough outline, but we have an idea and

**[06:45]** a rough outline, but we have an idea and

**[06:45]** a rough outline, but we have an idea and we would get in front of our users.

**[06:47]** we would get in front of our users.

**[06:47]** we would get in front of our users. Heck, it's 2025. We can v code this. We

**[06:49]** Heck, it's 2025. We can v code this. We

**[06:49]** Heck, it's 2025. We can v code this. We can ask at GPT or CL to do it. But just

**[06:52]** can ask at GPT or CL to do it. But just

**[06:52]** can ask at GPT or CL to do it. But just going through this process was critical

**[06:55]** going through this process was critical

**[06:55]** going through this process was critical for us to sell in the feedback. And when

**[06:57]** for us to sell in the feedback. And when we were working with our early users, we


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** we were working with our early users, we

**[07:00]** we were working with our early users, we shipping this document to them, getting

**[07:02]** shipping this document to them, getting

**[07:02]** shipping this document to them, getting feedback before we even went out

**[07:03]** feedback before we even went out

**[07:03]** feedback before we even went out building, before we even were doing a

**[07:05]** building, before we even were doing a

**[07:05]** building, before we even were doing a prototype in Figma or bold these days.

**[07:08]** prototype in Figma or bold these days.

**[07:08]** prototype in Figma or bold these days. And this was how we immature that from

**[07:10]** And this was how we immature that from

**[07:10]** And this was how we immature that from day one, we had a product feedback loop

**[07:12]** day one, we had a product feedback loop

**[07:12]** day one, we had a product feedback loop and we had real feedback getting to us

**[07:15]** and we had real feedback getting to us

**[07:15]** and we had real feedback getting to us as we were building.

**[07:17]** as we were building.

**[07:17]** as we were building. And another thing I learned over the

**[07:19]** And another thing I learned over the

**[07:19]** And another thing I learned over the years is that it's incredibly hard to do

**[07:21]** years is that it's incredibly hard to do

**[07:21]** years is that it's incredibly hard to do this. But you got to design your best

**[07:24]** this. But you got to design your best

**[07:24]** this. But you got to design your best product before you start considering all

**[07:26]** product before you start considering all

**[07:26]** product before you start considering all the constraints like legal, compliance,

**[07:28]** the constraints like legal, compliance,

**[07:28]** the constraints like legal, compliance, financial, etc. And what I mean by this

**[07:30]** financial, etc. And what I mean by this

**[07:30]** financial, etc. And what I mean by this is that it's it's very easy to sit down

**[07:33]** is that it's it's very easy to sit down

**[07:33]** is that it's it's very easy to sit down and when you kick off a product to

**[07:34]** and when you kick off a product to

**[07:34]** and when you kick off a product to understand all the legal constraints,

**[07:35]** understand all the legal constraints,

**[07:35]** understand all the legal constraints, all the financials, but that's not how

**[07:37]** all the financials, but that's not how

**[07:38]** all the financials, but that's not how you build the best product. Sure, like

**[07:40]** you build the best product. Sure, like

**[07:40]** you build the best product. Sure, like by the day you ship in production, you

**[07:42]** by the day you ship in production, you

**[07:42]** by the day you ship in production, you need to have a product that's

**[07:43]** need to have a product that's

**[07:43]** need to have a product that's financially viable, compliant, ticks all

**[07:45]** financially viable, compliant, ticks all

**[07:45]** financially viable, compliant, ticks all the boxes, but you cannot let your legal

**[07:48]** the boxes, but you cannot let your legal

**[07:48]** the boxes, but you cannot let your legal counterparts

**[07:49]** counterparts

**[07:49]** counterparts be the ones that are this applying

**[07:52]** be the ones that are this applying

**[07:52]** be the ones that are this applying judgment over your product. The way I've

**[07:54]** judgment over your product. The way I've

**[07:54]** judgment over your product. The way I've been working with my counterparts and

**[07:57]** been working with my counterparts and

**[07:57]** been working with my counterparts and it's really about like they are here to

**[07:59]** it's really about like they are here to

**[07:59]** it's really about like they are here to help me understand the legal risks, but


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:02]** help me understand the legal risks, but

**[08:02]** help me understand the legal risks, but they are not the shaping the product.

**[08:04]** they are not the shaping the product.

**[08:04]** they are not the shaping the product. And I really think it's just important

**[08:06]** And I really think it's just important

**[08:06]** And I really think it's just important that you think about like working with

**[08:08]** that you think about like working with

**[08:08]** that you think about like working with your various counterparts in your

**[08:09]** your various counterparts in your

**[08:09]** your various counterparts in your organization that they can help you

**[08:11]** organization that they can help you

**[08:11]** organization that they can help you understand the product space, but it's

**[08:13]** understand the product space, but it's

**[08:13]** understand the product space, but it's your job to to actually make those

**[08:15]** your job to to actually make those

**[08:15]** your job to to actually make those calls.

**[08:17]** calls.

**[08:17]** calls. And here in in 2025, like the reality is

**[08:21]** And here in in 2025, like the reality is

**[08:21]** And here in in 2025, like the reality is that we can actually build in an

**[08:23]** that we can actually build in an

**[08:23]** that we can actually build in an incredible amount of things. And I think

**[08:26]** incredible amount of things. And I think

**[08:26]** incredible amount of things. And I think back then we were doing paper

**[08:27]** back then we were doing paper

**[08:27]** back then we were doing paper prototypes, we were doing a lot of

**[08:28]** prototypes, we were doing a lot of

**[08:28]** prototypes, we were doing a lot of things, but today we can just bite code

**[08:30]** things, but today we can just bite code

**[08:30]** things, but today we can just bite code iterations of of the product shape. And

**[08:33]** iterations of of the product shape. And

**[08:33]** iterations of of the product shape. And the reality is that you have really no

**[08:36]** the reality is that you have really no

**[08:36]** the reality is that you have really no excuse whether you're a product leader

**[08:38]** excuse whether you're a product leader

**[08:38]** excuse whether you're a product leader or you are an engineer, you have no

**[08:40]** or you are an engineer, you have no

**[08:40]** or you are an engineer, you have no excuse not to do a prototype because

**[08:42]** excuse not to do a prototype because

**[08:42]** excuse not to do a prototype because it's gotten so easy to do.

**[08:46]** it's gotten so easy to do.

**[08:46]** it's gotten so easy to do. And I I just think this is important to

**[08:47]** And I I just think this is important to

**[08:47]** And I I just think this is important to internalize regardless of whether you

**[08:49]** internalize regardless of whether you

**[08:49]** internalize regardless of whether you have a technical background, you're most

**[08:51]** have a technical background, you're most

**[08:52]** have a technical background, you're most focused on the strategy, you can go to

**[08:53]** focused on the strategy, you can go to

**[08:53]** focused on the strategy, you can go to bold and you can hack something together

**[08:55]** bold and you can hack something together

**[08:55]** bold and you can hack something together very very fast.

**[08:57]** very very fast.

**[08:57]** very very fast. And the other thing that we learned over

**[08:59]** And the other thing that we learned over

**[08:59]** And the other thing that we learned over the years is that the key thing that


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:01]** the years is that the key thing that

**[09:01]** the years is that the key thing that helped us navigate things was to get

**[09:03]** helped us navigate things was to get

**[09:03]** helped us navigate things was to get high quality feedback and high bandwidth

**[09:05]** high quality feedback and high bandwidth

**[09:05]** high quality feedback and high bandwidth feedback from our users. And what I mean

**[09:07]** feedback from our users. And what I mean

**[09:07]** feedback from our users. And what I mean by this is is that it's very easy to

**[09:09]** by this is is that it's very easy to

**[09:09]** by this is is that it's very easy to slap slap on some metrics and build a

**[09:11]** slap slap on some metrics and build a

**[09:11]** slap slap on some metrics and build a dashboard, but doesn't help you get get

**[09:14]** dashboard, but doesn't help you get get

**[09:14]** dashboard, but doesn't help you get get any quality feedback that can help you

**[09:17]** any quality feedback that can help you

**[09:17]** any quality feedback that can help you understand how things are really going.

**[09:19]** understand how things are really going.

**[09:19]** understand how things are really going. So in the early days when we did a

**[09:21]** So in the early days when we did a

**[09:21]** So in the early days when we did a prototype of something, we'd go to the

**[09:22]** prototype of something, we'd go to the

**[09:22]** prototype of something, we'd go to the our customers office, shadow them as

**[09:26]** our customers office, shadow them as

**[09:26]** our customers office, shadow them as they were integrating the APIs and

**[09:28]** they were integrating the APIs and

**[09:28]** they were integrating the APIs and really get that visual feedback. I know

**[09:30]** really get that visual feedback. I know

**[09:30]** really get that visual feedback. I know it's not possible we can always go to

**[09:31]** it's not possible we can always go to

**[09:31]** it's not possible we can always go to our customers offices. So get them into

**[09:33]** our customers offices. So get them into

**[09:33]** our customers offices. So get them into a Slack channel, get them into Discord.

**[09:36]** a Slack channel, get them into Discord.

**[09:36]** a Slack channel, get them into Discord. The best customer relationships I've had

**[09:37]** The best customer relationships I've had

**[09:37]** The best customer relationships I've had is people I'm texting with. I'm

**[09:39]** is people I'm texting with. I'm

**[09:40]** is people I'm texting with. I'm available and I want to learn how you're

**[09:41]** available and I want to learn how you're

**[09:41]** available and I want to learn how you're using your product.

**[09:43]** using your product.

**[09:44]** using your product. And even when we were building our APIs,

**[09:46]** And even when we were building our APIs,

**[09:46]** And even when we were building our APIs, I would we would be monitoring

**[09:47]** I would we would be monitoring

**[09:47]** I would we would be monitoring rigorously the the API responses and see

**[09:50]** rigorously the the API responses and see

**[09:50]** rigorously the the API responses and see where people uh got stuck and we would

**[09:53]** where people uh got stuck and we would

**[09:53]** where people uh got stuck and we would really work with a very few set of users

**[09:56]** really work with a very few set of users

**[09:56]** really work with a very few set of users and make them extremely happy. And I

**[09:59]** and make them extremely happy. And I

**[09:59]** and make them extremely happy. And I think that's probably the the other


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** think that's probably the the other

**[10:00]** think that's probably the the other thing is that I think um um if you put

**[10:04]** thing is that I think um um if you put

**[10:04]** thing is that I think um um if you put this if you do this well, it should feel

**[10:06]** this if you do this well, it should feel

**[10:06]** this if you do this well, it should feel like you're running a professional

**[10:07]** like you're running a professional

**[10:07]** like you're running a professional services firm for your customers in the

**[10:09]** services firm for your customers in the

**[10:09]** services firm for your customers in the early days. like you should really feel

**[10:12]** early days. like you should really feel

**[10:12]** early days. like you should really feel like I'm delivering this piece of

**[10:13]** like I'm delivering this piece of

**[10:13]** like I'm delivering this piece of functionality to these five people and

**[10:16]** functionality to these five people and

**[10:16]** functionality to these five people and that's all I do because the reality is

**[10:18]** that's all I do because the reality is

**[10:18]** that's all I do because the reality is that most products fail

**[10:21]** that most products fail

**[10:21]** that most products fail um not because they're only useful for

**[10:23]** um not because they're only useful for

**[10:23]** um not because they're only useful for very few users but because they're not

**[10:25]** very few users but because they're not

**[10:25]** very few users but because they're not useful at all because you build the

**[10:27]** useful at all because you build the

**[10:27]** useful at all because you build the wrong thing. So this is a a a thing that

**[10:30]** wrong thing. So this is a a a thing that

**[10:30]** wrong thing. So this is a a a thing that that we learned early on as we were

**[10:32]** that we learned early on as we were

**[10:32]** that we learned early on as we were building out various products. And when

**[10:33]** building out various products. And when

**[10:33]** building out various products. And when I was building VS Code, I would be in

**[10:36]** I was building VS Code, I would be in

**[10:36]** I was building VS Code, I would be in people's DMs. I would be understanding

**[10:39]** people's DMs. I would be understanding

**[10:39]** people's DMs. I would be understanding why people couldn't uh get the right

**[10:41]** why people couldn't uh get the right

**[10:41]** why people couldn't uh get the right completions for the CSS token or why the

**[10:42]** completions for the CSS token or why the

**[10:42]** completions for the CSS token or why the JavaScript debugger didn't work. I would

**[10:44]** JavaScript debugger didn't work. I would

**[10:44]** JavaScript debugger didn't work. I would be over and shadowing people so we could

**[10:47]** be over and shadowing people so we could

**[10:47]** be over and shadowing people so we could make a few users very very successful.

**[10:51]** make a few users very very successful.

**[10:51]** make a few users very very successful. Um,

**[10:52]** Um,

**[10:52]** Um, and the other thing that I learned

**[10:54]** and the other thing that I learned

**[10:54]** and the other thing that I learned throughout the the years is that just a

**[10:56]** throughout the the years is that just a

**[10:56]** throughout the the years is that just a side note, APIs are much much harder

**[10:57]** side note, APIs are much much harder

**[10:58]** side note, APIs are much much harder than UI. What I mean by this is that


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** than UI. What I mean by this is that

**[11:00]** than UI. What I mean by this is that once you have an API and a data

**[11:02]** once you have an API and a data

**[11:02]** once you have an API and a data structure out there and is shipped, it's

**[11:04]** structure out there and is shipped, it's

**[11:04]** structure out there and is shipped, it's incredibly hard to change. It's much

**[11:06]** incredibly hard to change. It's much

**[11:06]** incredibly hard to change. It's much much easier to move move a button

**[11:08]** much easier to move move a button

**[11:08]** much easier to move move a button around. And it's this just when you work

**[11:11]** around. And it's this just when you work

**[11:11]** around. And it's this just when you work on more platformy kind of things that

**[11:13]** on more platformy kind of things that

**[11:13]** on more platformy kind of things that has APIs and other abstractions, it

**[11:15]** has APIs and other abstractions, it

**[11:16]** has APIs and other abstractions, it really just puts emphasis on that you

**[11:17]** really just puts emphasis on that you

**[11:18]** really just puts emphasis on that you need to work with a small set of users

**[11:21]** need to work with a small set of users

**[11:21]** need to work with a small set of users that are discerning. At Stripe, we

**[11:23]** that are discerning. At Stripe, we

**[11:23]** that are discerning. At Stripe, we always were were talking about the

**[11:24]** always were were talking about the

**[11:24]** always were were talking about the discerning developer and how we could

**[11:27]** discerning developer and how we could

**[11:27]** discerning developer and how we could build a surprisingly great developer

**[11:29]** build a surprisingly great developer

**[11:29]** build a surprisingly great developer experience and make very very few users

**[11:31]** experience and make very very few users

**[11:31]** experience and make very very few users happy to begin with. And when you work

**[11:33]** happy to begin with. And when you work

**[11:33]** happy to begin with. And when you work with APIs, you need to have that trusted

**[11:35]** with APIs, you need to have that trusted

**[11:35]** with APIs, you need to have that trusted group of customers you're working with

**[11:36]** group of customers you're working with

**[11:36]** group of customers you're working with that you can iterate with. And it's just

**[11:39]** that you can iterate with. And it's just

**[11:39]** that you can iterate with. And it's just like just for context, you know, once

**[11:40]** like just for context, you know, once

**[11:40]** like just for context, you know, once you have an API out there, it might be

**[11:42]** you have an API out there, it might be

**[11:42]** you have an API out there, it might be an afternoon for change for you, but it

**[11:43]** an afternoon for change for you, but it

**[11:43]** an afternoon for change for you, but it might be a six-month long migration for

**[11:45]** might be a six-month long migration for

**[11:45]** might be a six-month long migration for your customer because you're locked into

**[11:46]** your customer because you're locked into

**[11:46]** your customer because you're locked into your APIs and data structures. So, this

**[11:48]** your APIs and data structures. So, this

**[11:48]** your APIs and data structures. So, this is something to think about as you're

**[11:50]** is something to think about as you're

**[11:50]** is something to think about as you're building platforms. So, so Kennet, how

**[11:53]** building platforms. So, so Kennet, how

**[11:53]** building platforms. So, so Kennet, how the heck does all this relate to AI? We

**[11:55]** the heck does all this relate to AI? We

**[11:55]** the heck does all this relate to AI? We had an AI conference. Um I saw some nice

**[11:59]** had an AI conference. Um I saw some nice

**[11:59]** had an AI conference. Um I saw some nice illustrations from Clare Rules talk


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:01]** illustrations from Clare Rules talk brilliant talk and it's just true to

**[12:03]** brilliant talk and it's just true to

**[12:03]** brilliant talk and it's just true to like I think she had some really great

**[12:36]** don't think anything is changing with AI

**[12:36]** don't think anything is changing with AI when it comes to the craft of building

**[12:38]** when it comes to the craft of building

**[12:38]** when it comes to the craft of building products. What I've outlined here in the

**[12:41]** products. What I've outlined here in the

**[12:41]** products. What I've outlined here in the tactical things you you got to do

**[12:43]** tactical things you you got to do

**[12:43]** tactical things you you got to do whether you're using AI or not and

**[12:45]** whether you're using AI or not and

**[12:45]** whether you're using AI or not and you're building AI product is the same

**[12:46]** you're building AI product is the same

**[12:46]** you're building AI product is the same process. You need to talk to users get a

**[12:48]** process. You need to talk to users get a

**[12:48]** process. You need to talk to users get a feedback loop going and the reality is

**[12:52]** feedback loop going and the reality is

**[12:52]** feedback loop going and the reality is that AI will accelerate all aspects of

**[12:54]** that AI will accelerate all aspects of

**[12:54]** that AI will accelerate all aspects of product building. all the things I just

**[13:26]** the end of the day, it's the same job to be done. Um, and

**[13:30]** be done. Um, and

**[13:30]** be done. Um, and I I actually think like

**[13:33]** I I actually think like

**[13:33]** I I actually think like the product management aspect of

**[13:36]** the product management aspect of

**[13:36]** the product management aspect of building great products is just going to

**[13:38]** building great products is just going to

**[13:38]** building great products is just going to be much more important as we as we are

**[13:40]** be much more important as we as we are

**[13:40]** be much more important as we as we are now in a world where the cost of writing

**[13:41]** now in a world where the cost of writing

**[13:42]** now in a world where the cost of writing code is going to zero. The building

**[13:43]** code is going to zero. The building

**[13:44]** code is going to zero. The building piece here is no longer the critical

**[13:46]** piece here is no longer the critical

**[13:46]** piece here is no longer the critical thing. What's much more critical is that

**[13:50]** thing. What's much more critical is that

**[13:50]** thing. What's much more critical is that you have deep customer knowledge and you

**[13:52]** you have deep customer knowledge and you

**[13:52]** you have deep customer knowledge and you know who you're building for and you can

**[13:53]** know who you're building for and you can

**[13:53]** know who you're building for and you can get feedback as fast as possible and you

**[13:57]** get feedback as fast as possible and you

**[13:57]** get feedback as fast as possible and you need to leverage all the various tools

**[13:59]** need to leverage all the various tools

**[13:59]** need to leverage all the various tools to get these feedback loops going. But


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** to get these feedback loops going. But

**[14:01]** to get these feedback loops going. But in a world where we talk about AI native

**[14:03]** in a world where we talk about AI native

**[14:03]** in a world where we talk about AI native development and put an emphasis on the

**[14:04]** development and put an emphasis on the

**[14:04]** development and put an emphasis on the spec instead of code. I actually think

**[14:06]** spec instead of code. I actually think

**[14:06]** spec instead of code. I actually think there's going to be a much more emphasis

**[14:08]** there's going to be a much more emphasis

**[14:08]** there's going to be a much more emphasis on knowing who you're building for

**[14:09]** on knowing who you're building for

**[14:10]** on knowing who you're building for because you can just iterate incredibly

**[14:11]** because you can just iterate incredibly

**[14:11]** because you can just iterate incredibly fast. And you know I am now on the

**[14:15]** fast. And you know I am now on the

**[14:15]** fast. And you know I am now on the venture side of things and I spend a lot

**[14:16]** venture side of things and I spend a lot

**[14:16]** venture side of things and I spend a lot of time thinking about early stage in

**[14:19]** of time thinking about early stage in

**[14:19]** of time thinking about early stage in investment and what the new kind of

**[14:20]** investment and what the new kind of

**[14:20]** investment and what the new kind of bagable founders are and how they're

**[14:22]** bagable founders are and how they're

**[14:22]** bagable founders are and how they're building. And I I did this essay

**[14:25]** building. And I I did this essay

**[14:25]** building. And I I did this essay recently about what I call AI native

**[14:27]** recently about what I call AI native

**[14:27]** recently about what I call AI native founders. And I think the traits also

**[14:29]** founders. And I think the traits also

**[14:29]** founders. And I think the traits also for product leaders is that the winners

**[14:31]** for product leaders is that the winners

**[14:31]** for product leaders is that the winners will be the founders who can build

**[14:32]** will be the founders who can build

**[14:32]** will be the founders who can build tastefully, understand customers deeply

**[14:36]** tastefully, understand customers deeply

**[14:36]** tastefully, understand customers deeply and keep an incredibly high iteration

**[14:39]** and keep an incredibly high iteration

**[14:39]** and keep an incredibly high iteration velocity. And breaking it down is really

**[14:41]** velocity. And breaking it down is really

**[14:42]** velocity. And breaking it down is really about taste. I know we're in in SF and

**[14:44]** about taste. I know we're in in SF and

**[14:44]** about taste. I know we're in in SF and it's a overused kind of term these days,

**[14:46]** it's a overused kind of term these days,

**[14:46]** it's a overused kind of term these days, but taste, deep customer knowledge,

**[14:48]** but taste, deep customer knowledge,

**[14:48]** but taste, deep customer knowledge, iteration veloc velocity, you having

**[14:52]** iteration veloc velocity, you having

**[14:52]** iteration veloc velocity, you having distribution for your product and you

**[14:54]** distribution for your product and you

**[14:54]** distribution for your product and you being able to sell. To me, this sounds

**[14:56]** being able to sell. To me, this sounds

**[14:56]** being able to sell. To me, this sounds like a lot like product management.

**[14:59]** like a lot like product management.

**[14:59]** like a lot like product management. And this is just going to be much more


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:01]** And this is just going to be much more

**[15:01]** And this is just going to be much more important going forward.

**[15:03]** important going forward.

**[15:04]** important going forward. Um, I pulled a a tweet here for from

**[15:06]** Um, I pulled a a tweet here for from

**[15:06]** Um, I pulled a a tweet here for from Michelle over at OpenAI. And I think she

**[15:08]** Michelle over at OpenAI. And I think she

**[15:08]** Michelle over at OpenAI. And I think she capt. Shipping is so hard because it's a

**[15:11]** capt. Shipping is so hard because it's a

**[15:11]** capt. Shipping is so hard because it's a low entropy state. There are millions

**[15:13]** low entropy state. There are millions

**[15:13]** low entropy state. There are millions ways your launch can get derailed, but

**[15:15]** ways your launch can get derailed, but

**[15:16]** ways your launch can get derailed, but only a helpful ways that every that you

**[15:18]** only a helpful ways that every that you

**[15:18]** only a helpful ways that every that you can line everything up in order to ship.

**[15:20]** can line everything up in order to ship.

**[15:20]** can line everything up in order to ship. The universe does not want you to ship,

**[15:22]** The universe does not want you to ship,

**[15:22]** The universe does not want you to ship, but you must do it anyway. And I think

**[15:25]** but you must do it anyway. And I think

**[15:25]** but you must do it anyway. And I think that's our job to build the right

**[15:27]** that's our job to build the right

**[15:27]** that's our job to build the right products, have a feedback loop with our

**[15:29]** products, have a feedback loop with our

**[15:29]** products, have a feedback loop with our customers, and find a way to ship.

**[15:32]** customers, and find a way to ship.

**[15:32]** customers, and find a way to ship. So really like next time you're stuck in

**[15:34]** So really like next time you're stuck in

**[15:34]** So really like next time you're stuck in a discussion with your team, you're

**[15:36]** a discussion with your team, you're

**[15:36]** a discussion with your team, you're sitting in a heated product review or

**[15:39]** sitting in a heated product review or

**[15:39]** sitting in a heated product review or you're just debating with your team, I'm

**[15:41]** you're just debating with your team, I'm

**[15:41]** you're just debating with your team, I'm trying to remind my teams when I was

**[15:43]** trying to remind my teams when I was

**[15:43]** trying to remind my teams when I was operating is that shipping something to

**[15:46]** operating is that shipping something to

**[15:46]** operating is that shipping something to someone always wins and solves a debate

**[15:49]** someone always wins and solves a debate

**[15:49]** someone always wins and solves a debate when you get real feedback from real

**[15:51]** when you get real feedback from real

**[15:51]** when you get real feedback from real people instead of you being stuck in in

**[15:53]** people instead of you being stuck in in

**[15:53]** people instead of you being stuck in in a high level conversation. And the main

**[15:56]** a high level conversation. And the main

**[15:56]** a high level conversation. And the main takeaway I want to give you all from

**[15:58]** takeaway I want to give you all from

**[15:58]** takeaway I want to give you all from from this talk is that think about that


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:01]** from this talk is that think about that

**[16:01]** from this talk is that think about that skateboard. Think about how you can

**[16:02]** skateboard. Think about how you can

**[16:02]** skateboard. Think about how you can build the minimal viable

**[16:05]** build the minimal viable

**[16:05]** build the minimal viable product shape that you can iterate on

**[16:07]** product shape that you can iterate on

**[16:07]** product shape that you can iterate on with real users.

**[16:10]** with real users.

**[16:10]** with real users. Thank you.
