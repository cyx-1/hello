**[00:17]** Thanks for coming, by the way, and uh

**[00:17]** Thanks for coming, by the way, and uh for sticking around for a little while.

**[00:19]** for sticking around for a little while.

**[00:19]** for sticking around for a little while. Um, if you aren't prepared, I hate to

**[00:23]** Um, if you aren't prepared, I hate to

**[00:23]** Um, if you aren't prepared, I hate to break it to you, but this time next

**[00:25]** break it to you, but this time next

**[00:25]** break it to you, but this time next year, half of us won't even be here

**[00:26]** year, half of us won't even be here

**[00:26]** year, half of us won't even be here anymore. That's basically if you listen

**[00:29]** anymore. That's basically if you listen

**[00:29]** anymore. That's basically if you listen to whatever the hype is about AI and AI

**[00:33]** to whatever the hype is about AI and AI

**[00:33]** to whatever the hype is about AI and AI coding. You know, there's lots of

**[00:36]** coding. You know, there's lots of

**[00:36]** coding. You know, there's lots of fanfare, no disrespect, very intelligent

**[00:38]** fanfare, no disrespect, very intelligent

**[00:38]** fanfare, no disrespect, very intelligent people um that made these quotes. Um but

**[00:41]** people um that made these quotes. Um but

**[00:42]** people um that made these quotes. Um but I think they're probably wrong. Not

**[00:44]** I think they're probably wrong. Not

**[00:44]** I think they're probably wrong. Not because I don't think AI coding is going

**[00:46]** because I don't think AI coding is going

**[00:46]** because I don't think AI coding is going somewhere important, but probably

**[00:48]** somewhere important, but probably

**[00:48]** somewhere important, but probably because they haven't actually touched a

**[00:49]** because they haven't actually touched a

**[00:49]** because they haven't actually touched a production system in a very very long

**[00:51]** production system in a very very long

**[00:51]** production system in a very very long time. And so maybe generating code at

**[00:55]** time. And so maybe generating code at

**[00:55]** time. And so maybe generating code at 30% isn't really what they think it is

**[00:58]** 30% isn't really what they think it is

**[00:58]** 30% isn't really what they think it is because


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** because

**[01:00]** because really AI code is still code. One thing

**[01:03]** really AI code is still code. One thing

**[01:03]** really AI code is still code. One thing they don't really recognize in this

**[01:04]** they don't really recognize in this

**[01:04]** they don't really recognize in this space is that they're working in very

**[01:07]** space is that they're working in very

**[01:07]** space is that they're working in very very very large code bases that have

**[01:09]** very very large code bases that have

**[01:10]** very very large code bases that have basically every decision that's ever

**[01:11]** basically every decision that's ever

**[01:11]** basically every decision that's ever needed to be made about that code, about

**[01:14]** needed to be made about that code, about

**[01:14]** needed to be made about that code, about that architecture, about that

**[01:16]** that architecture, about that

**[01:16]** that architecture, about that infrastructure has already been made for

**[01:18]** infrastructure has already been made for

**[01:18]** infrastructure has already been made for them. So if I'm generating 30% of my

**[01:20]** them. So if I'm generating 30% of my

**[01:20]** them. So if I'm generating 30% of my code against, you know, let's say

**[01:22]** code against, you know, let's say

**[01:22]** code against, you know, let's say they're doing thousands of lines a day

**[01:24]** they're doing thousands of lines a day

**[01:24]** they're doing thousands of lines a day against millions of lines of new code of

**[01:27]** against millions of lines of new code of

**[01:27]** against millions of lines of new code of of existing code, there's not a lot of

**[01:28]** of existing code, there's not a lot of

**[01:28]** of existing code, there's not a lot of wiggle room for what that code can do or

**[01:31]** wiggle room for what that code can do or

**[01:31]** wiggle room for what that code can do or should do, right? Like it's just another

**[01:33]** should do, right? Like it's just another

**[01:33]** should do, right? Like it's just another button. If you've ever, no offense,

**[01:35]** button. If you've ever, no offense,

**[01:35]** button. If you've ever, no offense, anyone from meta here before I start

**[01:36]** anyone from meta here before I start

**[01:36]** anyone from meta here before I start ripping on meta. No, no meta. Great.

**[01:39]** ripping on meta. No, no meta. Great.

**[01:39]** ripping on meta. No, no meta. Great. I'll rip on meta for a minute. If you've

**[01:40]** I'll rip on meta for a minute. If you've

**[01:40]** I'll rip on meta for a minute. If you've ever talked to a meta engineer, they

**[01:42]** ever talked to a meta engineer, they

**[01:42]** ever talked to a meta engineer, they will talk about how they built a button

**[01:44]** will talk about how they built a button

**[01:44]** will talk about how they built a button in the ads platform for six months. like

**[01:46]** in the ads platform for six months. like

**[01:46]** in the ads platform for six months. like that's that's what they worked on for

**[01:48]** that's that's what they worked on for

**[01:48]** that's that's what they worked on for six months. That was their job. So like

**[01:49]** six months. That was their job. So like

**[01:50]** six months. That was their job. So like there's very little definition about

**[01:51]** there's very little definition about

**[01:51]** there's very little definition about like what this can needs to do that has

**[01:54]** like what this can needs to do that has

**[01:54]** like what this can needs to do that has wiggle room that AI really struck can

**[01:57]** wiggle room that AI really struck can

**[01:57]** wiggle room that AI really struck can influence. Next AI is still writing


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** influence. Next AI is still writing

**[02:00]** influence. Next AI is still writing code. This is code we have written for

**[02:02]** code. This is code we have written for

**[02:02]** code. This is code we have written for 50 years. Same programming languages.

**[02:04]** 50 years. Same programming languages.

**[02:04]** 50 years. Same programming languages. Nothing is different there. That code

**[02:06]** Nothing is different there. That code

**[02:06]** Nothing is different there. That code still needs to run in production

**[02:07]** still needs to run in production

**[02:07]** still needs to run in production somewhere. And if you're not familiar

**[02:09]** somewhere. And if you're not familiar

**[02:09]** somewhere. And if you're not familiar with if you haven't run a large

**[02:10]** with if you haven't run a large

**[02:10]** with if you haven't run a large production system, even if you write a

**[02:12]** production system, even if you write a

**[02:12]** production system, even if you write a great line of code, in complex systems,

**[02:15]** great line of code, in complex systems,

**[02:15]** great line of code, in complex systems, things fail. Like complex systems have

**[02:17]** things fail. Like complex systems have

**[02:17]** things fail. Like complex systems have emergent behavior that don't show up in

**[02:19]** emergent behavior that don't show up in

**[02:19]** emergent behavior that don't show up in just single lines of code. And so we

**[02:21]** just single lines of code. And so we

**[02:21]** just single lines of code. And so we still have to run this stuff. And so

**[02:23]** still have to run this stuff. And so

**[02:23]** still have to run this stuff. And so who's going to fix it? Who's going to

**[02:24]** who's going to fix it? Who's going to

**[02:24]** who's going to fix it? Who's going to examine it? Who's going to understand

**[02:26]** examine it? Who's going to understand

**[02:26]** examine it? Who's going to understand those nuances when uh when if you don't

**[02:29]** those nuances when uh when if you don't

**[02:29]** those nuances when uh when if you don't have software engineers? So I think

**[02:31]** have software engineers? So I think

**[02:31]** have software engineers? So I think we're still going to have software

**[02:32]** we're still going to have software

**[02:32]** we're still going to have software engineers. And then also history repeats

**[02:34]** engineers. And then also history repeats

**[02:34]** engineers. And then also history repeats itself. This is not the first time I

**[02:36]** itself. This is not the first time I

**[02:36]** itself. This is not the first time I have been told that my career is over.

**[02:39]** have been told that my career is over.

**[02:39]** have been told that my career is over. Um, I'm getting in on the on the years

**[02:42]** Um, I'm getting in on the on the years

**[02:42]** Um, I'm getting in on the on the years at this point in time, but anyone uh

**[02:44]** at this point in time, but anyone uh

**[02:44]** at this point in time, but anyone uh around like the DevOps transformation

**[02:45]** around like the DevOps transformation

**[02:45]** around like the DevOps transformation from 15 years ago, cloud, all the all

**[02:48]** from 15 years ago, cloud, all the all

**[02:48]** from 15 years ago, cloud, all the all the CIS admins that I know that were

**[02:50]** the CIS admins that I know that were

**[02:50]** the CIS admins that I know that were racking boxes and booting kernels, all

**[02:53]** racking boxes and booting kernels, all

**[02:53]** racking boxes and booting kernels, all got payraises and all work on much more

**[02:55]** got payraises and all work on much more

**[02:55]** got payraises and all work on much more valuable things now. They're much

**[02:57]** valuable things now. They're much

**[02:57]** valuable things now. They're much happier doing the work they're doing.

**[02:58]** happier doing the work they're doing.

**[02:58]** happier doing the work they're doing. So, this isn't new. This is just a


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** So, this isn't new. This is just a

**[03:00]** So, this isn't new. This is just a different level of abstraction, right?

**[03:02]** different level of abstraction, right?

**[03:02]** different level of abstraction, right? Like tractors didn't get rid of farms.

**[03:04]** Like tractors didn't get rid of farms.

**[03:04]** Like tractors didn't get rid of farms. They just got rid of farm hands and

**[03:05]** They just got rid of farm hands and

**[03:05]** They just got rid of farm hands and horses. Yeah. Like yes, there will be

**[03:07]** horses. Yeah. Like yes, there will be

**[03:07]** horses. Yeah. Like yes, there will be change in an industry for certain. But

**[03:09]** change in an industry for certain. But

**[03:09]** change in an industry for certain. But tractors didn't get rid of farming. We

**[03:11]** tractors didn't get rid of farming. We

**[03:11]** tractors didn't get rid of farming. We still have to farm.

**[03:14]** still have to farm.

**[03:14]** still have to farm. So vibes. Anyone here a vibe coder? It's

**[03:18]** So vibes. Anyone here a vibe coder? It's

**[03:18]** So vibes. Anyone here a vibe coder? It's okay if you are. No shame. Anyone and

**[03:20]** okay if you are. No shame. Anyone and

**[03:20]** okay if you are. No shame. Anyone and who here thinks call would call

**[03:22]** who here thinks call would call

**[03:22]** who here thinks call would call themselves a soft a professional

**[03:23]** themselves a soft a professional

**[03:23]** themselves a soft a professional software engineer? Great. So vibe

**[03:26]** software engineer? Great. So vibe

**[03:26]** software engineer? Great. So vibe coding, if you're not familiar with the

**[03:27]** coding, if you're not familiar with the

**[03:27]** coding, if you're not familiar with the term, I think everyone in this room is,

**[03:28]** term, I think everyone in this room is,

**[03:28]** term, I think everyone in this room is, but I'll do a quick summary, is

**[03:30]** but I'll do a quick summary, is

**[03:30]** but I'll do a quick summary, is basically letting the AI write all of

**[03:32]** basically letting the AI write all of

**[03:32]** basically letting the AI write all of the code and think through the code and

**[03:34]** the code and think through the code and

**[03:34]** the code and think through the code and not really examining the code at all.

**[03:35]** not really examining the code at all.

**[03:35]** not really examining the code at all. Just does it do what I need it to do?

**[03:37]** Just does it do what I need it to do?

**[03:37]** Just does it do what I need it to do? And then in that case, like I just keep

**[03:41]** And then in that case, like I just keep

**[03:41]** And then in that case, like I just keep going and let it keep going. Let keep

**[03:42]** going and let it keep going. Let keep

**[03:42]** going and let it keep going. Let keep going. Don't don't examine the code and

**[03:44]** going. Don't don't examine the code and

**[03:44]** going. Don't don't examine the code and edit it that way. But that's not what

**[03:46]** edit it that way. But that's not what

**[03:46]** edit it that way. But that's not what we're talking about. We're I'm talking

**[03:47]** we're talking about. We're I'm talking

**[03:47]** we're talking about. We're I'm talking about how can we write code that's for

**[03:49]** about how can we write code that's for

**[03:49]** about how can we write code that's for production. And when I say production, I

**[03:52]** production. And when I say production, I

**[03:52]** production. And when I say production, I mean, you you have four nines. Do you

**[03:54]** mean, you you have four nines. Do you

**[03:54]** mean, you you have four nines. Do you even know what 49s means? That's

**[03:56]** even know what 49s means? That's

**[03:56]** even know what 49s means? That's production code. You have thousands of

**[03:58]** production code. You have thousands of

**[03:58]** production code. You have thousands of users, gigabytes of data. We're talking


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** users, gigabytes of data. We're talking

**[04:01]** users, gigabytes of data. We're talking software that runs the internet today.

**[04:03]** software that runs the internet today.

**[04:04]** software that runs the internet today. Vibes don't cut that because there's a

**[04:06]** Vibes don't cut that because there's a

**[04:06]** Vibes don't cut that because there's a lot of like nuances on what goes into

**[04:08]** lot of like nuances on what goes into

**[04:08]** lot of like nuances on what goes into code. So, first let's clear up one

**[04:11]** code. So, first let's clear up one

**[04:11]** code. So, first let's clear up one misconception. Code is not the job in

**[04:14]** misconception. Code is not the job in

**[04:14]** misconception. Code is not the job in the same way that blueprints are not the

**[04:16]** the same way that blueprints are not the

**[04:16]** the same way that blueprints are not the job of an architect. That's an artifact

**[04:18]** job of an architect. That's an artifact

**[04:18]** job of an architect. That's an artifact of being an architect. The artifact of

**[04:20]** of being an architect. The artifact of

**[04:20]** of being an architect. The artifact of being a a software developer is code.

**[04:22]** being a a software developer is code.

**[04:22]** being a a software developer is code. Sure. Yeah, I have to output some code,

**[04:23]** Sure. Yeah, I have to output some code,

**[04:24]** Sure. Yeah, I have to output some code, but I make thousands of decisions about

**[04:26]** but I make thousands of decisions about

**[04:26]** but I make thousands of decisions about what my software is supposed to do, what

**[04:28]** what my software is supposed to do, what

**[04:28]** what my software is supposed to do, what kind of what I'm writing, what packages

**[04:31]** kind of what I'm writing, what packages

**[04:31]** kind of what I'm writing, what packages I'm bringing in. So, let's stop

**[04:33]** I'm bringing in. So, let's stop

**[04:33]** I'm bringing in. So, let's stop conflating generating code with the art

**[04:35]** conflating generating code with the art

**[04:36]** conflating generating code with the art and the the craft of doing software

**[04:37]** and the the craft of doing software

**[04:37]** and the the craft of doing software engineering. Those are different things.

**[04:39]** engineering. Those are different things.

**[04:39]** engineering. Those are different things. And so, yes, LLMs are great at producing

**[04:42]** And so, yes, LLMs are great at producing

**[04:42]** And so, yes, LLMs are great at producing code, but are they is that the same as

**[04:45]** code, but are they is that the same as

**[04:45]** code, but are they is that the same as writing production software?

**[04:47]** writing production software?

**[04:47]** writing production software? So, a very smart person that uh started

**[04:50]** So, a very smart person that uh started

**[04:50]** So, a very smart person that uh started Stack Overflow, Jeff Atwood, rest in

**[04:51]** Stack Overflow, Jeff Atwood, rest in

**[04:51]** Stack Overflow, Jeff Atwood, rest in peace, Stack Overflow, um said the best

**[04:55]** peace, Stack Overflow, um said the best

**[04:55]** peace, Stack Overflow, um said the best code is no code at all. And I think

**[04:56]** code is no code at all. And I think

**[04:56]** code is no code at all. And I think that's true because every line of code

**[04:58]** that's true because every line of code

**[04:58]** that's true because every line of code comes with comes with a burden, right? I


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** comes with comes with a burden, right? I

**[05:00]** comes with comes with a burden, right? I have to maintain that code. I have to

**[05:01]** have to maintain that code. I have to

**[05:01]** have to maintain that code. I have to debug that code. So, every line of code

**[05:03]** debug that code. So, every line of code

**[05:03]** debug that code. So, every line of code I generate I have to be responsible for.

**[05:06]** I generate I have to be responsible for.

**[05:06]** I generate I have to be responsible for. And so, we've been we spent so much time

**[05:09]** And so, we've been we spent so much time

**[05:09]** And so, we've been we spent so much time thinking about like how much code can AI

**[05:10]** thinking about like how much code can AI

**[05:10]** thinking about like how much code can AI generate? Who cares how much it can

**[05:12]** generate? Who cares how much it can

**[05:12]** generate? Who cares how much it can generate? the more it generates, the

**[05:14]** generate? the more it generates, the

**[05:14]** generate? the more it generates, the worse off I end up being, worse off the

**[05:16]** worse off I end up being, worse off the

**[05:16]** worse off I end up being, worse off the system ends up being. We want to put as

**[05:18]** system ends up being. We want to put as

**[05:18]** system ends up being. We want to put as little code as possible in there because

**[05:20]** little code as possible in there because

**[05:20]** little code as possible in there because all codes has trade-offs, right? Like we

**[05:23]** all codes has trade-offs, right? Like we

**[05:23]** all codes has trade-offs, right? Like we recognize this package has this

**[05:25]** recognize this package has this

**[05:25]** recognize this package has this performance characteristic. This this

**[05:27]** performance characteristic. This this

**[05:27]** performance characteristic. This this methodology has this the best example I

**[05:30]** methodology has this the best example I

**[05:30]** methodology has this the best example I can give you which I'll I'll try to get

**[05:31]** can give you which I'll I'll try to get

**[05:31]** can give you which I'll I'll try to get through so you can all get back to

**[05:33]** through so you can all get back to

**[05:33]** through so you can all get back to snacks is the difference between like a

**[05:35]** snacks is the difference between like a

**[05:35]** snacks is the difference between like a monolith uh an microservices

**[05:37]** monolith uh an microservices

**[05:37]** monolith uh an microservices architecture and an adventure system.

**[05:39]** architecture and an adventure system.

**[05:39]** architecture and an adventure system. How many decisions go into those kinds

**[05:41]** How many decisions go into those kinds

**[05:41]** How many decisions go into those kinds of architectures and the choices you

**[05:43]** of architectures and the choices you

**[05:43]** of architectures and the choices you have to make to do the same thing? Like

**[05:45]** have to make to do the same thing? Like

**[05:45]** have to make to do the same thing? Like if you ever if you built a flight

**[05:47]** if you ever if you built a flight

**[05:47]** if you ever if you built a flight booking system in all three of these,

**[05:49]** booking system in all three of these,

**[05:49]** booking system in all three of these, you have thousands of individual

**[05:51]** you have thousands of individual

**[05:51]** you have thousands of individual decisions that have to get made. LLMs

**[05:53]** decisions that have to get made. LLMs

**[05:53]** decisions that have to get made. LLMs don't make decisions. They generate

**[05:55]** don't make decisions. They generate

**[05:55]** don't make decisions. They generate text. They generate patterns. And at

**[05:58]** text. They generate patterns. And at

**[05:58]** text. They generate patterns. And at some scale, at some point, there's no


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** some scale, at some point, there's no

**[06:01]** some scale, at some point, there's no pattern for my software. Anyone here run

**[06:03]** pattern for my software. Anyone here run

**[06:03]** pattern for my software. Anyone here run a piece of production software that's

**[06:04]** a piece of production software that's

**[06:04]** a piece of production software that's kind of a bit of a snowflake? Has a

**[06:06]** kind of a bit of a snowflake? Has a

**[06:06]** kind of a bit of a snowflake? Has a bunch of like idiosyncrasies in it that

**[06:08]** bunch of like idiosyncrasies in it that

**[06:08]** bunch of like idiosyncrasies in it that like well only Bob knows how that works

**[06:11]** like well only Bob knows how that works

**[06:11]** like well only Bob knows how that works and only Jane can fix that. She wrote it

**[06:13]** and only Jane can fix that. She wrote it

**[06:13]** and only Jane can fix that. She wrote it six years ago and hasn't been on the

**[06:14]** six years ago and hasn't been on the

**[06:14]** six years ago and hasn't been on the project and that is software. So at some

**[06:17]** project and that is software. So at some

**[06:17]** project and that is software. So at some scale pattern matching doesn't work

**[06:19]** scale pattern matching doesn't work

**[06:19]** scale pattern matching doesn't work anymore because all of the nuances that

**[06:21]** anymore because all of the nuances that

**[06:21]** anymore because all of the nuances that go into all that software can't be

**[06:23]** go into all that software can't be

**[06:23]** go into all that software can't be pattern matched against. So when when

**[06:25]** pattern matched against. So when when

**[06:25]** pattern matched against. So when when the software is going down, this is my

**[06:27]** the software is going down, this is my

**[06:27]** the software is going down, this is my like trauma of like carrying a pager.

**[06:29]** like trauma of like carrying a pager.

**[06:29]** like trauma of like carrying a pager. When when software goes down at two in

**[06:31]** When when software goes down at two in

**[06:31]** When when software goes down at two in the morning, vibes aren't going to fix

**[06:33]** the morning, vibes aren't going to fix

**[06:33]** the morning, vibes aren't going to fix the bug. Like someone has to diagnose

**[06:35]** the bug. Like someone has to diagnose

**[06:35]** the bug. Like someone has to diagnose that problem. So what is the work of

**[06:38]** that problem. So what is the work of

**[06:38]** that problem. So what is the work of software engineering? For me, that's

**[06:41]** software engineering? For me, that's

**[06:41]** software engineering? For me, that's changing software safely. That's been my

**[06:43]** changing software safely. That's been my

**[06:43]** changing software safely. That's been my job for 20 years is how can I make

**[06:45]** job for 20 years is how can I make

**[06:45]** job for 20 years is how can I make changes to software, whether that's

**[06:47]** changes to software, whether that's

**[06:47]** changes to software, whether that's adding new functionality or changing

**[06:48]** adding new functionality or changing

**[06:48]** adding new functionality or changing existing code. And how do I do it safely

**[06:50]** existing code. And how do I do it safely

**[06:50]** existing code. And how do I do it safely so that software doesn't go down? So my

**[06:52]** so that software doesn't go down? So my

**[06:52]** so that software doesn't go down? So my users get their get the thing that

**[06:53]** users get their get the thing that

**[06:54]** users get their get the thing that they're getting, they the widget ships,

**[06:55]** they're getting, they the widget ships,

**[06:56]** they're getting, they the widget ships, that um you know, data is secure. So,

**[06:58]** that um you know, data is secure. So,

**[06:58]** that um you know, data is secure. So, how do we how have we done that so far


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** how do we how have we done that so far

**[07:00]** how do we how have we done that so far in the industry? We've done lots of

**[07:02]** in the industry? We've done lots of

**[07:02]** in the industry? We've done lots of different things to solve that problem.

**[07:03]** different things to solve that problem.

**[07:03]** different things to solve that problem. One, there's just my own knowledge. I

**[07:05]** One, there's just my own knowledge. I

**[07:05]** One, there's just my own knowledge. I have to like learn a ton about a

**[07:07]** have to like learn a ton about a

**[07:07]** have to like learn a ton about a codebase before I can make changes

**[07:08]** codebase before I can make changes

**[07:08]** codebase before I can make changes safely. Uh, we use version control to do

**[07:10]** safely. Uh, we use version control to do

**[07:10]** safely. Uh, we use version control to do that. We know testing, you know, like

**[07:12]** that. We know testing, you know, like

**[07:12]** that. We know testing, you know, like that's why we write tests to catch if

**[07:14]** that's why we write tests to catch if

**[07:14]** that's why we write tests to catch if like if I change this, did this thing

**[07:15]** like if I change this, did this thing

**[07:16]** like if I change this, did this thing break over here? Um, we use type

**[07:17]** break over here? Um, we use type

**[07:18]** break over here? Um, we use type systems. We use deployment strategies.

**[07:20]** systems. We use deployment strategies.

**[07:20]** systems. We use deployment strategies. Can AI start to help us? Can context

**[07:22]** Can AI start to help us? Can context

**[07:22]** Can AI start to help us? Can context that an AI has about and can understand

**[07:25]** that an AI has about and can understand

**[07:25]** that an AI has about and can understand more of the codebase help us? probably

**[07:28]** more of the codebase help us? probably

**[07:28]** more of the codebase help us? probably you know at augment we believe that

**[07:30]** you know at augment we believe that

**[07:30]** you know at augment we believe that context is like the most important part

**[07:31]** context is like the most important part

**[07:32]** context is like the most important part of all AI generation in code so yeah we

**[07:35]** of all AI generation in code so yeah we

**[07:35]** of all AI generation in code so yeah we think we can solve that problem that

**[07:36]** think we can solve that problem that

**[07:36]** think we can solve that problem that doesn't change that I still have to care

**[07:40]** doesn't change that I still have to care

**[07:40]** doesn't change that I still have to care about production so let's just assume

**[07:43]** about production so let's just assume

**[07:43]** about production so let's just assume that we're writing code like okay the

**[07:45]** that we're writing code like okay the

**[08:27]** can't do what it's going to do So I want

**[08:27]** can't do what it's going to do So I want to talk about that for just just a

**[08:28]** to talk about that for just just a

**[08:28]** to talk about that for just just a couple minutes. So a few years ago, AI

**[08:31]** couple minutes. So a few years ago, AI

**[08:31]** couple minutes. So a few years ago, AI coding was mostly just a pile of bricks.

**[08:34]** coding was mostly just a pile of bricks.

**[08:34]** coding was mostly just a pile of bricks. Like it kind of worked but really didn't

**[08:36]** Like it kind of worked but really didn't

**[08:36]** Like it kind of worked but really didn't do much. Um about a year ago, you know,

**[08:39]** do much. Um about a year ago, you know,

**[08:39]** do much. Um about a year ago, you know, years and change when Sonic uh 35 came

**[08:42]** years and change when Sonic uh 35 came

**[08:42]** years and change when Sonic uh 35 came out, that's really when we saw a massive

**[08:44]** out, that's really when we saw a massive

**[08:44]** out, that's really when we saw a massive explosion um in in AI coding because the

**[08:47]** explosion um in in AI coding because the

**[08:47]** explosion um in in AI coding because the quality substantially jumped. Um, and

**[08:50]** quality substantially jumped. Um, and

**[08:50]** quality substantially jumped. Um, and then four weeks ago, if you weren't

**[08:52]** then four weeks ago, if you weren't

**[08:52]** then four weeks ago, if you weren't watching the news, literally every AI

**[08:54]** watching the news, literally every AI

**[08:54]** watching the news, literally every AI coding tool said like agents are the

**[08:57]** coding tool said like agents are the

**[08:57]** coding tool said like agents are the future. Uh, we did. Um, very proud of


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** future. Uh, we did. Um, very proud of

**[09:00]** future. Uh, we did. Um, very proud of that. But like now agents are

**[09:02]** that. But like now agents are

**[09:02]** that. But like now agents are everywhere, right? And so this

**[09:03]** everywhere, right? And so this

**[09:03]** everywhere, right? And so this transformation has happened uh very very

**[09:06]** transformation has happened uh very very

**[09:06]** transformation has happened uh very very quickly. Uh, and so I want to talk about

**[09:08]** quickly. Uh, and so I want to talk about

**[09:08]** quickly. Uh, and so I want to talk about how we can talk do software engineering

**[09:11]** how we can talk do software engineering

**[09:11]** how we can talk do software engineering with this new future that we're seeing.

**[09:14]** with this new future that we're seeing.

**[09:14]** with this new future that we're seeing. Um, so how do you build software that's

**[09:17]** Um, so how do you build software that's

**[09:17]** Um, so how do you build software that's easy for AI to write? Uh, a couple tips

**[09:20]** easy for AI to write? Uh, a couple tips

**[09:20]** easy for AI to write? Uh, a couple tips for you. Um, have some documented

**[09:22]** for you. Um, have some documented

**[09:26]** what do you use? Every codebase I know

**[09:26]** what do you use? Every codebase I know is in some sort of flux, right? So like

**[09:28]** is in some sort of flux, right? So like

**[09:28]** is in some sort of flux, right? So like are we using this package or this

**[09:30]** are we using this package or this

**[09:30]** are we using this package or this package? Okay, well document that. Let

**[09:32]** package? Okay, well document that. Let

**[09:32]** package? Okay, well document that. Let the AI know that this is the next

**[09:33]** the AI know that this is the next

**[09:33]** the AI know that this is the next direction of your codebase. Um, have

**[09:36]** direction of your codebase. Um, have

**[09:36]** direction of your codebase. Um, have reproducible environments, right? Like

**[09:38]** reproducible environments, right? Like

**[09:38]** reproducible environments, right? Like can you easily spin up a developer

**[09:40]** can you easily spin up a developer

**[09:40]** can you easily spin up a developer environment? Is your developer

**[09:42]** environment? Is your developer

**[09:42]** environment? Is your developer environment very bespoke and unique? Um,

**[09:44]** environment very bespoke and unique? Um,

**[09:44]** environment very bespoke and unique? Um, you want to have it reproducible. We

**[09:47]** you want to have it reproducible. We

**[09:47]** you want to have it reproducible. We want to have easy testing, right? like

**[09:49]** want to have easy testing, right? like

**[09:49]** want to have easy testing, right? like can you run your tests locally? Can is

**[09:51]** can you run your tests locally? Can is

**[09:51]** can you run your tests locally? Can is that fast? Uh you know that's pretty

**[09:53]** that fast? Uh you know that's pretty

**[09:53]** that fast? Uh you know that's pretty pretty standard stuff. Um establish

**[09:55]** pretty standard stuff. Um establish

**[09:55]** pretty standard stuff. Um establish clear boundaries of what you're going to

**[09:56]** clear boundaries of what you're going to

**[09:56]** clear boundaries of what you're going to do. You're never going to give AI the

**[09:59]** do. You're never going to give AI the

**[09:59]** do. You're never going to give AI the idea of like uh extract this module


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:01]** idea of like uh extract this module

**[10:01]** idea of like uh extract this module using the strangler pattern. What does

**[10:03]** using the strangler pattern. What does

**[10:03]** using the strangler pattern. What does that even mean to an AI like that's a

**[10:05]** that even mean to an AI like that's a

**[10:05]** that even mean to an AI like that's a whole you have to give clear boundaries

**[10:07]** whole you have to give clear boundaries

**[10:07]** whole you have to give clear boundaries of what you're trying to build and how

**[10:08]** of what you're trying to build and how

**[10:08]** of what you're trying to build and how to get the AI to do it. And lastly like

**[10:11]** to get the AI to do it. And lastly like

**[10:11]** to get the AI to do it. And lastly like have clearly defined tasks and work. Um

**[10:14]** have clearly defined tasks and work. Um

**[10:14]** have clearly defined tasks and work. Um because AI is going to be as you know I

**[10:17]** because AI is going to be as you know I

**[10:17]** because AI is going to be as you know I wouldn't give any engineer on my team

**[10:18]** wouldn't give any engineer on my team

**[10:18]** wouldn't give any engineer on my team whether they're senior staff junior just

**[10:21]** whether they're senior staff junior just

**[10:21]** whether they're senior staff junior just a vague task of like could you make this

**[10:22]** a vague task of like could you make this

**[10:22]** a vague task of like could you make this button do something different like I see

**[10:25]** button do something different like I see

**[10:25]** button do something different like I see too many engineers prompting in that way

**[10:28]** too many engineers prompting in that way

**[10:28]** too many engineers prompting in that way and what's interesting about this to me

**[10:29]** and what's interesting about this to me

**[10:30]** and what's interesting about this to me is like this just sounds like software

**[10:32]** is like this just sounds like software

**[10:32]** is like this just sounds like software engineering right like if we don't if

**[10:35]** engineering right like if we don't if

**[10:35]** engineering right like if we don't if ideally your software engineering stack

**[10:36]** ideally your software engineering stack

**[10:36]** ideally your software engineering stack looks has these qualities and if it

**[10:38]** looks has these qualities and if it

**[10:38]** looks has these qualities and if it doesn't you're like our productivity

**[10:40]** doesn't you're like our productivity

**[10:40]** doesn't you're like our productivity sucks because we have you know bespoke

**[10:42]** sucks because we have you know bespoke

**[10:42]** sucks because we have you know bespoke testing infrastructure ffstruure. We

**[10:44]** testing infrastructure ffstruure. We

**[10:44]** testing infrastructure ffstruure. We have bespoke developer environments. You

**[10:46]** have bespoke developer environments. You

**[10:46]** have bespoke developer environments. You have to give AI the same tools that

**[10:48]** have to give AI the same tools that

**[10:48]** have to give AI the same tools that engineers need because it's doing

**[10:50]** engineers need because it's doing

**[10:50]** engineers need because it's doing exactly the same job. It's writing code.

**[10:53]** exactly the same job. It's writing code.

**[10:53]** exactly the same job. It's writing code. I've never one-shot at a piece of code

**[10:54]** I've never one-shot at a piece of code

**[10:54]** I've never one-shot at a piece of code in my life personally. Like I've always

**[10:57]** in my life personally. Like I've always

**[10:57]** in my life personally. Like I've always made mistakes in the code I write. I run

**[10:59]** made mistakes in the code I write. I run

**[10:59]** made mistakes in the code I write. I run a test, it fails. I've got a llinter, it


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:01]** a test, it fails. I've got a llinter, it

**[11:01]** a test, it fails. I've got a llinter, it fixes it, whatever thing is. But we've

**[11:04]** fixes it, whatever thing is. But we've

**[11:04]** fixes it, whatever thing is. But we've had this expectation that AI can like

**[11:06]** had this expectation that AI can like

**[11:06]** had this expectation that AI can like write perfect code. And I don't know

**[11:08]** write perfect code. And I don't know

**[11:08]** write perfect code. And I don't know why. And so when you're thinking about

**[11:10]** why. And so when you're thinking about

**[11:10]** why. And so when you're thinking about adopting AI as a software engineer, you

**[11:12]** adopting AI as a software engineer, you

**[11:12]** adopting AI as a software engineer, you have to make sure that your your systems

**[11:14]** have to make sure that your your systems

**[11:14]** have to make sure that your your systems work like you would expect any other

**[11:16]** work like you would expect any other

**[11:16]** work like you would expect any other engineer to work because that's how it's

**[11:18]** engineer to work because that's how it's

**[11:18]** engineer to work because that's how it's writing code.

**[11:20]** writing code.

**[11:20]** writing code. The next thing is code review is by far

**[11:23]** The next thing is code review is by far

**[11:23]** The next thing is code review is by far the most important skill. Um I think

**[11:25]** the most important skill. Um I think

**[11:25]** the most important skill. Um I think we've probably forgotten that skill as

**[11:27]** we've probably forgotten that skill as

**[11:27]** we've probably forgotten that skill as an industry. Um we probably should have

**[11:29]** an industry. Um we probably should have

**[11:29]** an industry. Um we probably should have been interviewing for code review and

**[11:31]** been interviewing for code review and

**[11:31]** been interviewing for code review and not like here's this esoteric leak code

**[11:33]** not like here's this esoteric leak code

**[11:33]** not like here's this esoteric leak code problem that you could solve, but like

**[11:34]** problem that you could solve, but like

**[11:34]** problem that you could solve, but like can you read somebody else's code and

**[11:36]** can you read somebody else's code and

**[11:36]** can you read somebody else's code and comment on why it's good or bad? Um, I

**[11:38]** comment on why it's good or bad? Um, I

**[11:38]** comment on why it's good or bad? Um, I think this is going to become far more

**[11:39]** think this is going to become far more

**[11:39]** think this is going to become far more important as agents are writing more and

**[11:42]** important as agents are writing more and

**[11:42]** important as agents are writing more and more code and our code review tools

**[11:44]** more code and our code review tools

**[11:44]** more code and our code review tools today frankly suck. Like I'm getting a

**[11:47]** today frankly suck. Like I'm getting a

**[11:47]** today frankly suck. Like I'm getting a list of changed files. It's

**[11:48]** list of changed files. It's

**[11:48]** list of changed files. It's lexographically sorted. So like great

**[11:50]** lexographically sorted. So like great

**[11:50]** lexographically sorted. So like great file A changed. Let me read what changed

**[11:52]** file A changed. Let me read what changed

**[11:52]** file A changed. Let me read what changed in file A. What changed in file B?

**[11:54]** in file A. What changed in file B?

**[11:54]** in file A. What changed in file B? That's not a way to think about how

**[11:55]** That's not a way to think about how

**[11:55]** That's not a way to think about how software changes is in the order of the

**[11:57]** software changes is in the order of the

**[11:58]** software changes is in the order of the files. And so I think we're going to see


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** files. And so I think we're going to see

**[12:00]** files. And so I think we're going to see a pretty big explosion on the way code

**[12:02]** a pretty big explosion on the way code

**[12:02]** a pretty big explosion on the way code review can happen. Um, and that's the

**[12:03]** review can happen. Um, and that's the

**[12:04]** review can happen. Um, and that's the skill we need to be interviewing for.

**[12:05]** skill we need to be interviewing for.

**[12:05]** skill we need to be interviewing for. you need to be um like kind of brushing

**[12:07]** you need to be um like kind of brushing

**[12:07]** you need to be um like kind of brushing up on.

**[12:09]** up on.

**[12:09]** up on. All right, I'm running quick on time.

**[12:12]** All right, I'm running quick on time.

**[12:12]** All right, I'm running quick on time. So, I do want to give you a couple

**[12:13]** So, I do want to give you a couple

**[12:13]** So, I do want to give you a couple highlights of like if you are one of

**[12:15]** highlights of like if you are one of

**[12:15]** highlights of like if you are one of those software engineers is like I

**[12:16]** those software engineers is like I

**[12:16]** those software engineers is like I don't, you know, I'm not I don't trust

**[12:18]** don't, you know, I'm not I don't trust

**[12:18]** don't, you know, I'm not I don't trust AI. I need some tips. I want to give

**[12:20]** AI. I need some tips. I want to give

**[12:20]** AI. I need some tips. I want to give leave you a few of these. Um feel free

**[12:21]** leave you a few of these. Um feel free

**[12:22]** leave you a few of these. Um feel free to take a screenshot. One, the most

**[12:24]** to take a screenshot. One, the most

**[12:24]** to take a screenshot. One, the most important thing I can imagine is AI

**[12:27]** important thing I can imagine is AI

**[12:27]** important thing I can imagine is AI talks like a human but is actually a

**[12:28]** talks like a human but is actually a

**[12:28]** talks like a human but is actually a machine. I had this interaction with AI

**[12:31]** machine. I had this interaction with AI

**[12:31]** machine. I had this interaction with AI the other day where it was like uh you

**[12:33]** the other day where it was like uh you

**[12:33]** the other day where it was like uh you know I was yelling at it because that's

**[12:34]** know I was yelling at it because that's

**[12:34]** know I was yelling at it because that's what you do at AI when it doesn't do

**[12:35]** what you do at AI when it doesn't do

**[12:36]** what you do at AI when it doesn't do what you want it to do. And it's like oh

**[12:37]** what you want it to do. And it's like oh

**[12:37]** what you want it to do. And it's like oh I'm sorry I just scanned that file. I

**[12:39]** I'm sorry I just scanned that file. I

**[12:39]** I'm sorry I just scanned that file. I didn't read it. I'm like the does

**[12:41]** didn't read it. I'm like the does

**[12:41]** didn't read it. I'm like the does that even mean? What? How does a piece

**[12:44]** that even mean? What? How does a piece

**[12:44]** that even mean? What? How does a piece of software scan a file? It just like

**[12:46]** of software scan a file? It just like

**[12:46]** of software scan a file? It just like skimmed it. Like that's not a thing in

**[12:48]** skimmed it. Like that's not a thing in

**[12:48]** skimmed it. Like that's not a thing in software. It's because LLMs are trained

**[12:51]** software. It's because LLMs are trained

**[12:51]** software. It's because LLMs are trained on all the data in the world, right?

**[12:53]** on all the data in the world, right?

**[12:53]** on all the data in the world, right? There are thousands of emails that it

**[12:54]** There are thousands of emails that it

**[12:54]** There are thousands of emails that it has read that says like oh sorry I

**[12:56]** has read that says like oh sorry I

**[12:56]** has read that says like oh sorry I didn't read your document thoroughly. I

**[12:57]** didn't read your document thoroughly. I

**[12:57]** didn't read your document thoroughly. I actually just skimmed it. It's like, oh,

**[12:59]** actually just skimmed it. It's like, oh,

**[12:59]** actually just skimmed it. It's like, oh, that's what I should say when someone's


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** that's what I should say when someone's

**[13:00]** that's what I should say when someone's yelling at me about not reading a file,

**[13:02]** yelling at me about not reading a file,

**[13:02]** yelling at me about not reading a file, right? And so, we have we have to

**[13:05]** right? And so, we have we have to

**[13:05]** right? And so, we have we have to distrust some of the things that LLMs

**[13:07]** distrust some of the things that LLMs

**[13:07]** distrust some of the things that LLMs are saying they're doing because it's

**[13:08]** are saying they're doing because it's

**[13:08]** are saying they're doing because it's not actually doing that. Don't forget,

**[13:10]** not actually doing that. Don't forget,

**[13:10]** not actually doing that. Don't forget, it's just generating text. It's not

**[13:12]** it's just generating text. It's not

**[13:12]** it's just generating text. It's not always doing exactly what you're what

**[13:14]** always doing exactly what you're what

**[13:14]** always doing exactly what you're what it's outputting in that text. So, keep

**[13:16]** it's outputting in that text. So, keep

**[13:16]** it's outputting in that text. So, keep that in mind when you're write when

**[13:17]** that in mind when you're write when

**[13:17]** that in mind when you're write when you're reading through LLM output. Um,

**[13:21]** you're reading through LLM output. Um,

**[13:21]** you're reading through LLM output. Um, let's see what other tip quick tips can

**[13:23]** let's see what other tip quick tips can

**[13:23]** let's see what other tip quick tips can I give you. Sometimes code is just

**[13:26]** I give you. Sometimes code is just

**[13:26]** I give you. Sometimes code is just different. It's okay if the LLM outputs

**[13:28]** different. It's okay if the LLM outputs

**[13:28]** different. It's okay if the LLM outputs code differently than you would. I can't

**[13:30]** code differently than you would. I can't

**[13:30]** code differently than you would. I can't expect it to produce the code that I

**[13:32]** expect it to produce the code that I

**[13:32]** expect it to produce the code that I would exactly in the same way that like

**[13:34]** would exactly in the same way that like

**[13:34]** would exactly in the same way that like the person that's sitting next to me

**[13:35]** the person that's sitting next to me

**[13:35]** the person that's sitting next to me also writes code a little differently

**[13:37]** also writes code a little differently

**[13:37]** also writes code a little differently than I do. And so just accept that

**[13:39]** than I do. And so just accept that

**[13:39]** than I do. And so just accept that that's okay. And if you want to force it

**[13:41]** that's okay. And if you want to force it

**[13:41]** that's okay. And if you want to force it to write code like you, you can spend

**[13:43]** to write code like you, you can spend

**[13:43]** to write code like you, you can spend that energy, but know the difference of

**[13:45]** that energy, but know the difference of

**[13:46]** that energy, but know the difference of is the code better or is it just

**[13:47]** is the code better or is it just

**[13:47]** is the code better or is it just different? And so let go of some of that

**[13:50]** different? And so let go of some of that

**[13:50]** different? And so let go of some of that like this is how you know we this is why

**[13:52]** like this is how you know we this is why

**[13:52]** like this is how you know we this is why we have llinters. This is why we have

**[13:54]** we have llinters. This is why we have

**[13:54]** we have llinters. This is why we have rule systems. This is why we have style

**[13:56]** rule systems. This is why we have style

**[13:56]** rule systems. This is why we have style guides. So we can stop arguing about

**[13:58]** guides. So we can stop arguing about

**[13:58]** guides. So we can stop arguing about like is that how you define a function


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** like is that how you define a function

**[14:00]** like is that how you define a function or is this how you define a function.

**[14:02]** or is this how you define a function.

**[14:02]** or is this how you define a function. Let some of that go if you can. Um write

**[14:06]** Let some of that go if you can. Um write

**[14:06]** Let some of that go if you can. Um write a rules file. You know give it tell it

**[14:08]** a rules file. You know give it tell it

**[14:08]** a rules file. You know give it tell it what you want it to do. Have a file. I

**[14:10]** what you want it to do. Have a file. I

**[14:10]** what you want it to do. Have a file. I always start all of my projects with

**[14:12]** always start all of my projects with

**[14:12]** always start all of my projects with like here's the stack I'm using. Here's

**[14:14]** like here's the stack I'm using. Here's

**[14:14]** like here's the stack I'm using. Here's the like guidelines I want you to use.

**[14:16]** the like guidelines I want you to use.

**[14:16]** the like guidelines I want you to use. And that's always ends up being part of

**[14:18]** And that's always ends up being part of

**[14:18]** And that's always ends up being part of the context I send with the LLM. Um, and

**[14:20]** the context I send with the LLM. Um, and

**[14:20]** the context I send with the LLM. Um, and then lastly, I like to define create

**[14:23]** then lastly, I like to define create

**[14:23]** then lastly, I like to define create refine loop. Expect create a a document

**[14:26]** refine loop. Expect create a a document

**[14:26]** refine loop. Expect create a a document of some kind. Have the LM help you

**[14:28]** of some kind. Have the LM help you

**[14:28]** of some kind. Have the LM help you generate it. Like I'm doing this thing.

**[14:30]** generate it. Like I'm doing this thing.

**[14:30]** generate it. Like I'm doing this thing. Write a markdown file that would like

**[14:32]** Write a markdown file that would like

**[14:32]** Write a markdown file that would like lay out the plan. Here's my plan. Save

**[14:34]** lay out the plan. Here's my plan. Save

**[14:34]** lay out the plan. Here's my plan. Save that as a markdown file. Then use that

**[14:36]** that as a markdown file. Then use that

**[14:36]** that as a markdown file. Then use that again in your context. Have it create

**[14:38]** again in your context. Have it create

**[14:38]** again in your context. Have it create the thing. Have the agent run against

**[14:40]** the thing. Have the agent run against

**[14:40]** the thing. Have the agent run against that file. You know, you can make your

**[14:41]** that file. You know, you can make your

**[14:41]** that file. You know, you can make your edits to it and then refine it. then

**[14:44]** edits to it and then refine it. then

**[14:44]** edits to it and then refine it. then you're going in with, you know, code

**[14:45]** you're going in with, you know, code

**[14:46]** you're going in with, you know, code completions or whatever to like just

**[14:47]** completions or whatever to like just

**[14:47]** completions or whatever to like just tweak the things that you want to tweak

**[14:49]** tweak the things that you want to tweak

**[14:49]** tweak the things that you want to tweak and just do that loop over and over and

**[14:50]** and just do that loop over and over and

**[14:50]** and just do that loop over and over and over again. Make a plan, have it create

**[14:52]** over again. Make a plan, have it create

**[14:52]** over again. Make a plan, have it create it, and then just make your make your

**[14:54]** it, and then just make your make your

**[14:54]** it, and then just make your make your tweaks and you'll get a lot more

**[14:55]** tweaks and you'll get a lot more

**[14:56]** tweaks and you'll get a lot more comfortable one how to prompt the LLM to

**[14:58]** comfortable one how to prompt the LLM to

**[14:58]** comfortable one how to prompt the LLM to get the code you want to do as well as


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:01]** get the code you want to do as well as

**[15:01]** get the code you want to do as well as um that's just a very efficient way of

**[15:03]** um that's just a very efficient way of

**[15:03]** um that's just a very efficient way of coding. And if you've let go if you let

**[15:05]** coding. And if you've let go if you let

**[15:05]** coding. And if you've let go if you let go of that code has to be how I would

**[15:07]** go of that code has to be how I would

**[15:07]** go of that code has to be how I would write it, not just good functional code,

**[15:09]** write it, not just good functional code,

**[15:10]** write it, not just good functional code, then you can get a lot more productive

**[15:11]** then you can get a lot more productive

**[15:11]** then you can get a lot more productive in that way. Um, thanks again. Uh, I

**[15:15]** in that way. Um, thanks again. Uh, I

**[15:15]** in that way. Um, thanks again. Uh, I blasted through that. I'm happy to talk.

**[15:17]** blasted through that. I'm happy to talk.

**[15:17]** blasted through that. I'm happy to talk. Augment is in the expo hall. I'll be

**[15:19]** Augment is in the expo hall. I'll be

**[15:19]** Augment is in the expo hall. I'll be around there to chat or over here. Um, I

**[15:21]** around there to chat or over here. Um, I

**[15:21]** around there to chat or over here. Um, I hope to see you here next year. Hope

**[15:23]** hope to see you here next year. Hope

**[15:23]** hope to see you here next year. Hope we're all here next year. I think the

**[15:24]** we're all here next year. I think the

**[15:24]** we're all here next year. I think the jobs aren't going anywhere. Um, but

**[15:26]** jobs aren't going anywhere. Um, but

**[15:26]** jobs aren't going anywhere. Um, but happy coding. Really appreciate it.
