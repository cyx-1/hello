### [00:00 - 01:00]

**[00:17]** Hi everyone, my name is Alvo and I'm

**[00:17]** Hi everyone, my name is Alvo and I'm excited to chat today with you all about

**[00:19]** excited to chat today with you all about

**[00:19]** excited to chat today with you all about pricing strategies and how to think

**[00:21]** pricing strategies and how to think

**[00:21]** pricing strategies and how to think about monetiz monetization

**[00:23]** about monetiz monetization

**[00:23]** about monetiz monetization uh specifically around AI. This

**[00:26]** uh specifically around AI. This

**[00:26]** uh specifically around AI. This conference has and continues to be

**[00:27]** conference has and continues to be

**[00:27]** conference has and continues to be amazing where I'm walking down the hall

**[00:30]** amazing where I'm walking down the hall

**[00:30]** amazing where I'm walking down the hall and seeing innovation everywhere. And an

**[00:33]** and seeing innovation everywhere. And an

**[00:33]** and seeing innovation everywhere. And an idea that I think is really important is

**[00:35]** idea that I think is really important is

**[00:35]** idea that I think is really important is for there to be a successful innovation

**[00:36]** for there to be a successful innovation

**[00:36]** for there to be a successful innovation ecosystem. We also have have to think

**[00:39]** ecosystem. We also have have to think

**[00:39]** ecosystem. We also have have to think about how we capture that value and

**[00:41]** about how we capture that value and

**[00:41]** about how we capture that value and monetize effectively to reach the right

**[00:43]** monetize effectively to reach the right

**[00:43]** monetize effectively to reach the right group of folks and make sure that this

**[00:45]** group of folks and make sure that this

**[00:45]** group of folks and make sure that this becomes a self- sustaining and u

**[00:48]** becomes a self- sustaining and u

**[00:48]** becomes a self- sustaining and u effective ecosystem.

**[00:51]** effective ecosystem.

**[00:51]** effective ecosystem. I am the co-founder and CEO at Orb and

**[00:53]** I am the co-founder and CEO at Orb and

**[00:53]** I am the co-founder and CEO at Orb and we specialize in billing for AI and SAS

**[00:55]** we specialize in billing for AI and SAS

**[00:55]** we specialize in billing for AI and SAS companies and we've been immensely lucky

**[00:58]** companies and we've been immensely lucky

**[00:58]** companies and we've been immensely lucky to partner with companies all across the


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** to partner with companies all across the

**[01:00]** to partner with companies all across the AI stack and we've been uh a small part

**[01:04]** AI stack and we've been uh a small part

**[01:04]** AI stack and we've been uh a small part in helping some of these amazing

**[01:05]** in helping some of these amazing

**[01:05]** in helping some of these amazing companies ship incredible product

**[01:07]** companies ship incredible product

**[01:07]** companies ship incredible product experiences like Verscell's voter replet

**[01:09]** experiences like Verscell's voter replet

**[01:09]** experiences like Verscell's voter replet agent and perplexities API. So with this

**[01:13]** agent and perplexities API. So with this

**[01:13]** agent and perplexities API. So with this experience, the goal of my talk today is

**[01:15]** experience, the goal of my talk today is

**[01:15]** experience, the goal of my talk today is to share some stories from the field and

**[01:17]** to share some stories from the field and

**[01:17]** to share some stories from the field and bring forward uh some of this bleeding

**[01:20]** bring forward uh some of this bleeding

**[01:20]** bring forward uh some of this bleeding edge uh experimentation and ideas that

**[01:22]** edge uh experimentation and ideas that

**[01:22]** edge uh experimentation and ideas that are forming on the world of AI pricing.

**[01:25]** are forming on the world of AI pricing.

**[01:25]** are forming on the world of AI pricing. And I think a good place to start is to

**[01:28]** And I think a good place to start is to

**[01:28]** And I think a good place to start is to really think about what is unique and

**[01:30]** really think about what is unique and

**[01:30]** really think about what is unique and complex about AI pricing specifically. I

**[01:33]** complex about AI pricing specifically. I

**[01:33]** complex about AI pricing specifically. I think software pricing has always been a

**[01:34]** think software pricing has always been a

**[01:34]** think software pricing has always been a little bit of an art and a science and

**[01:36]** little bit of an art and a science and

**[01:36]** little bit of an art and a science and there's always been some considerations

**[01:37]** there's always been some considerations

**[01:37]** there's always been some considerations around how to get it right. But there

**[01:39]** around how to get it right. But there

**[01:39]** around how to get it right. But there are three things in particular that make

**[01:41]** are three things in particular that make

**[01:41]** are three things in particular that make considerations around AI pricing perhaps

**[01:43]** considerations around AI pricing perhaps

**[01:43]** considerations around AI pricing perhaps more challenging than they've been

**[01:45]** more challenging than they've been

**[01:45]** more challenging than they've been before. Well, first of all, things are

**[01:47]** before. Well, first of all, things are

**[01:47]** before. Well, first of all, things are changing dramatically quickly in terms

**[01:49]** changing dramatically quickly in terms

**[01:49]** changing dramatically quickly in terms of model model and inference costs, in

**[01:51]** of model model and inference costs, in

**[01:51]** of model model and inference costs, in terms of capabilities, in terms of new

**[01:53]** terms of capabilities, in terms of new

**[01:53]** terms of capabilities, in terms of new products being launched. So, uh just the

**[01:56]** products being launched. So, uh just the

**[01:56]** products being launched. So, uh just the the pace of this evolution makes it hard

**[01:59]** the pace of this evolution makes it hard

**[01:59]** the pace of this evolution makes it hard to keep pace on the pricing side.


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:02]** to keep pace on the pricing side.

**[02:02]** to keep pace on the pricing side. Second, these AI technologies create

**[02:04]** Second, these AI technologies create

**[02:04]** Second, these AI technologies create some real pressures on margins and cogs.

**[02:07]** some real pressures on margins and cogs.

**[02:07]** some real pressures on margins and cogs. So the thing that we could do maybe 10

**[02:08]** So the thing that we could do maybe 10

**[02:08]** So the thing that we could do maybe 10 years ago of like shipping our products

**[02:10]** years ago of like shipping our products

**[02:10]** years ago of like shipping our products and we'll figure out how to price them

**[02:12]** and we'll figure out how to price them

**[02:12]** and we'll figure out how to price them down the line is much harder to do when

**[02:15]** down the line is much harder to do when

**[02:15]** down the line is much harder to do when that anthropic or open a open AI bill is

**[02:18]** that anthropic or open a open AI bill is

**[02:18]** that anthropic or open a open AI bill is very steep and significant. And then

**[02:21]** very steep and significant. And then

**[02:21]** very steep and significant. And then third amidst all this experimentation

**[02:23]** third amidst all this experimentation

**[02:23]** third amidst all this experimentation exploration I think customers are really

**[02:24]** exploration I think customers are really

**[02:24]** exploration I think customers are really really hungry to understand what is the

**[02:26]** really hungry to understand what is the

**[02:26]** really hungry to understand what is the ROI that they are getting from from some

**[02:28]** ROI that they are getting from from some

**[02:28]** ROI that they are getting from from some of these technologies. So this makes AI

**[02:31]** of these technologies. So this makes AI

**[02:31]** of these technologies. So this makes AI pricing uniquely challenging and um this

**[02:34]** pricing uniquely challenging and um this

**[02:34]** pricing uniquely challenging and um this is even greater so when we keep getting

**[02:37]** is even greater so when we keep getting

**[02:37]** is even greater so when we keep getting blown away and surprised by the kind of

**[02:39]** blown away and surprised by the kind of

**[02:39]** blown away and surprised by the kind of um adoption trends and just uptick that

**[02:43]** um adoption trends and just uptick that

**[02:43]** um adoption trends and just uptick that a lot of these products have. When I say

**[02:45]** a lot of these products have. When I say

**[02:45]** a lot of these products have. When I say that AI pricing is is challenging, I

**[02:48]** that AI pricing is is challenging, I

**[02:48]** that AI pricing is is challenging, I really mean that it's kind of

**[02:50]** really mean that it's kind of

**[02:50]** really mean that it's kind of challenging for everybody where um

**[02:52]** challenging for everybody where um

**[02:52]** challenging for everybody where um notably we've seen even cases where uh

**[02:55]** notably we've seen even cases where uh

**[02:55]** notably we've seen even cases where uh ChiBBD Pro at $200 turns turned out to

**[02:58]** ChiBBD Pro at $200 turns turned out to

**[02:58]** ChiBBD Pro at $200 turns turned out to be a loss driver for the company. So I


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** be a loss driver for the company. So I

**[03:02]** be a loss driver for the company. So I come today to you with an idea that

**[03:03]** come today to you with an idea that

**[03:03]** come today to you with an idea that perhaps as an industry we should not be

**[03:05]** perhaps as an industry we should not be

**[03:05]** perhaps as an industry we should not be pricing on vibes and there is a

**[03:07]** pricing on vibes and there is a

**[03:08]** pricing on vibes and there is a potentially better way to do this. So to

**[03:10]** potentially better way to do this. So to

**[03:10]** potentially better way to do this. So to drive my point forward, I have come to

**[03:12]** drive my point forward, I have come to

**[03:12]** drive my point forward, I have come to you with three simple frameworks and one

**[03:14]** you with three simple frameworks and one

**[03:14]** you with three simple frameworks and one tool to share with you some ideas and

**[03:17]** tool to share with you some ideas and

**[03:17]** tool to share with you some ideas and and and frameworks for how to think

**[03:18]** and and frameworks for how to think

**[03:18]** and and frameworks for how to think about AI pricing and uh share with you a

**[03:21]** about AI pricing and uh share with you a

**[03:21]** about AI pricing and uh share with you a tool we've built at orb that is really

**[03:23]** tool we've built at orb that is really

**[03:23]** tool we've built at orb that is really helping some teams make the right

**[03:25]** helping some teams make the right

**[03:25]** helping some teams make the right decisions around their monetization. So

**[03:27]** decisions around their monetization. So

**[03:27]** decisions around their monetization. So well first and foremost like should you

**[03:29]** well first and foremost like should you

**[03:29]** well first and foremost like should you monetize AI? Um and how should you think

**[03:31]** monetize AI? Um and how should you think

**[03:32]** monetize AI? Um and how should you think about uh that uh that experience? So

**[03:35]** about uh that uh that experience? So

**[03:35]** about uh that uh that experience? So over here um I have a kind of simple

**[03:38]** over here um I have a kind of simple

**[03:38]** over here um I have a kind of simple framework uh that is one of my

**[03:40]** framework uh that is one of my

**[03:40]** framework uh that is one of my favorites. It's it was created by the

**[03:42]** favorites. It's it was created by the

**[03:42]** favorites. It's it was created by the folks at Simon Kutcher and it really

**[03:44]** folks at Simon Kutcher and it really

**[03:44]** folks at Simon Kutcher and it really starts asking about this idea of how um

**[03:47]** starts asking about this idea of how um

**[03:48]** starts asking about this idea of how um should you think about monetization?

**[03:49]** should you think about monetization?

**[03:49]** should you think about monetization? Should it be a direct monetization

**[03:51]** Should it be a direct monetization

**[03:51]** Should it be a direct monetization strategy where you are either selling

**[03:53]** strategy where you are either selling

**[03:53]** strategy where you are either selling something as a standalone product or

**[03:55]** something as a standalone product or

**[03:55]** something as a standalone product or charging it for it as an add-on? Or

**[03:57]** charging it for it as an add-on? Or

**[03:57]** charging it for it as an add-on? Or should it be an indirect monetization

**[03:59]** should it be an indirect monetization

**[03:59]** should it be an indirect monetization strategy where perhaps you're using it


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** strategy where perhaps you're using it

**[04:01]** strategy where perhaps you're using it to drive upsells into existing products

**[04:04]** to drive upsells into existing products

**[04:04]** to drive upsells into existing products or tiers that you have or maybe even

**[04:06]** or tiers that you have or maybe even

**[04:06]** or tiers that you have or maybe even bundling it for free because it's

**[04:08]** bundling it for free because it's

**[04:08]** bundling it for free because it's incentivizing the right behavior you

**[04:10]** incentivizing the right behavior you

**[04:10]** incentivizing the right behavior you want to see in your customers. So, let's

**[04:12]** want to see in your customers. So, let's

**[04:12]** want to see in your customers. So, let's look at some examples. This go GitHub

**[04:13]** look at some examples. This go GitHub

**[04:13]** look at some examples. This go GitHub co-pilot uh they launched it as a

**[04:16]** co-pilot uh they launched it as a

**[04:16]** co-pilot uh they launched it as a separable monetizable add-on on top of

**[04:19]** separable monetizable add-on on top of

**[04:19]** separable monetizable add-on on top of the base GitHub seat. An important

**[04:22]** the base GitHub seat. An important

**[04:22]** the base GitHub seat. An important consideration here is is this this new

**[04:25]** consideration here is is this this new

**[04:25]** consideration here is is this this new product is this new feature adding value

**[04:26]** product is this new feature adding value

**[04:26]** product is this new feature adding value to everybody in your audience or just a

**[04:29]** to everybody in your audience or just a

**[04:29]** to everybody in your audience or just a niche group of folks. Um and when it's

**[04:32]** niche group of folks. Um and when it's

**[04:32]** niche group of folks. Um and when it's maybe not everybody with a GitHub seat

**[04:34]** maybe not everybody with a GitHub seat

**[04:34]** maybe not everybody with a GitHub seat is going to get value out of this, maybe

**[04:36]** is going to get value out of this, maybe

**[04:36]** is going to get value out of this, maybe an add-on monetization strategy is a

**[04:38]** an add-on monetization strategy is a

**[04:38]** an add-on monetization strategy is a really good one.

**[04:40]** really good one.

**[04:40]** really good one. Second second example here is notion uh

**[04:42]** Second second example here is notion uh

**[04:42]** Second second example here is notion uh and notion AI. Notably they were first

**[04:44]** and notion AI. Notably they were first

**[04:44]** and notion AI. Notably they were first to market in their category and

**[04:46]** to market in their category and

**[04:46]** to market in their category and initially launched notion AI as an

**[04:48]** initially launched notion AI as an

**[04:48]** initially launched notion AI as an add-on like GitHub copilot still is. But

**[04:51]** add-on like GitHub copilot still is. But

**[04:51]** add-on like GitHub copilot still is. But recently they've bundled this into their

**[04:53]** recently they've bundled this into their

**[04:53]** recently they've bundled this into their business and enterprise tiers to kind of

**[04:55]** business and enterprise tiers to kind of

**[04:55]** business and enterprise tiers to kind of encourage um more adoption there. And as

**[04:58]** encourage um more adoption there. And as

**[04:58]** encourage um more adoption there. And as part of that u they've done some price


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** part of that u they've done some price

**[05:01]** part of that u they've done some price increases on those tiers. So they're

**[05:03]** increases on those tiers. So they're

**[05:03]** increases on those tiers. So they're they're finding ways to kind of

**[05:04]** they're finding ways to kind of

**[05:04]** they're finding ways to kind of encourage the the adoption that they

**[05:06]** encourage the the adoption that they

**[05:06]** encourage the the adoption that they want to see at those higher tiers.

**[05:09]** want to see at those higher tiers.

**[05:09]** want to see at those higher tiers. Finally, this this is a little bit of a

**[05:12]** Finally, this this is a little bit of a

**[05:12]** Finally, this this is a little bit of a more off the-beaten path example. A

**[05:14]** more off the-beaten path example. A

**[05:14]** more off the-beaten path example. A month ago, Expedia launched a new AI

**[05:17]** month ago, Expedia launched a new AI

**[05:17]** month ago, Expedia launched a new AI powered feature that lets you turn

**[05:20]** powered feature that lets you turn

**[05:20]** powered feature that lets you turn Instagram reels into bookable trips. And

**[05:23]** Instagram reels into bookable trips. And

**[05:23]** Instagram reels into bookable trips. And they're not charging for this. They have

**[05:25]** they're not charging for this. They have

**[05:25]** they're not charging for this. They have like released this out for free.

**[05:27]** like released this out for free.

**[05:27]** like released this out for free. They're doing this while swallowing

**[05:29]** They're doing this while swallowing

**[05:29]** They're doing this while swallowing those like cost to serve and model

**[05:31]** those like cost to serve and model

**[05:31]** those like cost to serve and model inference costs to power this capability

**[05:33]** inference costs to power this capability

**[05:33]** inference costs to power this capability because likely they are hoping to see a

**[05:36]** because likely they are hoping to see a

**[05:36]** because likely they are hoping to see a lot more bookings of travel as a result

**[05:38]** lot more bookings of travel as a result

**[05:38]** lot more bookings of travel as a result of this capability. So again, this is an

**[05:41]** of this capability. So again, this is an

**[05:41]** of this capability. So again, this is an example of cases where you might even

**[05:43]** example of cases where you might even

**[05:43]** example of cases where you might even want to indirectly monetize where you're

**[05:46]** want to indirectly monetize where you're

**[05:46]** want to indirectly monetize where you're not charging for this right away, but

**[05:48]** not charging for this right away, but

**[05:48]** not charging for this right away, but you are incenting the behavior that then

**[05:51]** you are incenting the behavior that then

**[05:51]** you are incenting the behavior that then will continue to fuel your revenue

**[05:53]** will continue to fuel your revenue

**[05:53]** will continue to fuel your revenue growth.

**[05:54]** growth.

**[05:54]** growth. Having explored like should you even

**[05:56]** Having explored like should you even

**[05:56]** Having explored like should you even monetize this how do we actually do it

**[05:59]** monetize this how do we actually do it

**[05:59]** monetize this how do we actually do it and I think one of the most important


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** and I think one of the most important

**[06:01]** and I think one of the most important considerations here is to make sure that

**[06:03]** considerations here is to make sure that

**[06:03]** considerations here is to make sure that you are picking and selecting the

**[06:05]** you are picking and selecting the

**[06:05]** you are picking and selecting the correct value metric so let's take the

**[06:07]** correct value metric so let's take the

**[06:07]** correct value metric so let's take the space of AI agents where uh literally AI

**[06:12]** space of AI agents where uh literally AI

**[06:12]** space of AI agents where uh literally AI agents are redefining the way that we

**[06:14]** agents are redefining the way that we

**[06:14]** agents are redefining the way that we get value out of software where before

**[06:16]** get value out of software where before

**[06:16]** get value out of software where before we measured the value of software by

**[06:18]** we measured the value of software by

**[06:18]** we measured the value of software by getting a login into a web application

**[06:21]** getting a login into a web application

**[06:21]** getting a login into a web application that we could like spend our days in now

**[06:23]** that we could like spend our days in now

**[06:23]** that we could like spend our days in now we have AI agents that are out there

**[06:25]** we have AI agents that are out there

**[06:25]** we have AI agents that are out there doing work for us or achieving

**[06:27]** doing work for us or achieving

**[06:27]** doing work for us or achieving automation or achieving outcomes for us.

**[06:30]** automation or achieving outcomes for us.

**[06:30]** automation or achieving outcomes for us. How do we price that? Um, I think what

**[06:32]** How do we price that? Um, I think what

**[06:32]** How do we price that? Um, I think what we're seeing out in the field,

**[06:33]** we're seeing out in the field,

**[06:33]** we're seeing out in the field, especially over the last six months, is

**[06:35]** especially over the last six months, is

**[06:35]** especially over the last six months, is that there's a little bit of a spectrum

**[06:37]** that there's a little bit of a spectrum

**[06:37]** that there's a little bit of a spectrum in terms of how tightly aligned to

**[06:40]** in terms of how tightly aligned to

**[06:40]** in terms of how tightly aligned to discrete units of value or more closely

**[06:42]** discrete units of value or more closely

**[06:42]** discrete units of value or more closely aligned to ROI do you want to be? And

**[06:44]** aligned to ROI do you want to be? And

**[06:44]** aligned to ROI do you want to be? And there's sort of a spectrum between very

**[06:46]** there's sort of a spectrum between very

**[06:46]** there's sort of a spectrum between very resource-based or tokenbased

**[06:48]** resource-based or tokenbased

**[06:48]** resource-based or tokenbased monetization models, proxies of value

**[06:51]** monetization models, proxies of value

**[06:51]** monetization models, proxies of value like steps in a workflow, maybe entire

**[06:53]** like steps in a workflow, maybe entire

**[06:53]** like steps in a workflow, maybe entire workflows, perhaps even more direct

**[06:56]** workflows, perhaps even more direct

**[06:56]** workflows, perhaps even more direct labor replacement type strategies where

**[06:58]** labor replacement type strategies where

**[06:58]** labor replacement type strategies where just like you would hire a consultant


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** just like you would hire a consultant

**[07:00]** just like you would hire a consultant per hour, maybe you would hire an agent

**[07:03]** per hour, maybe you would hire an agent

**[07:03]** per hour, maybe you would hire an agent per hour all the way to true

**[07:05]** per hour all the way to true

**[07:05]** per hour all the way to true outcomebased pricing. Let's run through

**[07:07]** outcomebased pricing. Let's run through

**[07:07]** outcomebased pricing. Let's run through some of these examples again. So here's

**[07:09]** some of these examples again. So here's

**[07:09]** some of these examples again. So here's Versels V0ero. They have a token-based

**[07:11]** Versels V0ero. They have a token-based

**[07:11]** Versels V0ero. They have a token-based model uh based on very granular

**[07:13]** model uh based on very granular

**[07:13]** model uh based on very granular capabilities and I think this aligns

**[07:15]** capabilities and I think this aligns

**[07:15]** capabilities and I think this aligns really closely with their audience with

**[07:28]** automation at scale and they've gone

**[07:28]** automation at scale and they've gone with a taskbased pricing strategy where

**[07:31]** with a taskbased pricing strategy where

**[07:31]** with a taskbased pricing strategy where various tasks in in an entire workflow

**[07:34]** various tasks in in an entire workflow

**[07:34]** various tasks in in an entire workflow or zap are the unit of value that you

**[07:36]** or zap are the unit of value that you

**[07:36]** or zap are the unit of value that you end up paying for and you actually

**[07:38]** end up paying for and you actually

**[07:38]** end up paying for and you actually subscribe to a certain number of tasks

**[07:40]** subscribe to a certain number of tasks

**[07:40]** subscribe to a certain number of tasks per month or can go over if you are

**[07:42]** per month or can go over if you are

**[07:42]** per month or can go over if you are exceeding that. And then finally there

**[07:45]** exceeding that. And then finally there

**[07:45]** exceeding that. And then finally there is true outcomebased pricing. So this is

**[07:48]** is true outcomebased pricing. So this is

**[07:48]** is true outcomebased pricing. So this is intercom's fin where the way Finn is

**[07:52]** intercom's fin where the way Finn is

**[07:52]** intercom's fin where the way Finn is priced is it charges 99 cents per

**[07:55]** priced is it charges 99 cents per

**[07:55]** priced is it charges 99 cents per successful customer support ticket

**[07:57]** successful customer support ticket

**[07:57]** successful customer support ticket resolution where literally if the end


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** resolution where literally if the end

**[08:00]** resolution where literally if the end user at the end of that support

**[08:02]** user at the end of that support

**[08:02]** user at the end of that support interaction says yes that answered my

**[08:04]** interaction says yes that answered my

**[08:04]** interaction says yes that answered my query and I don't need to escalate to a

**[08:06]** query and I don't need to escalate to a

**[08:06]** query and I don't need to escalate to a human support agent that's where Finn

**[08:09]** human support agent that's where Finn

**[08:09]** human support agent that's where Finn charges for 99 cents. And if you've been

**[08:11]** charges for 99 cents. And if you've been

**[08:11]** charges for 99 cents. And if you've been on LinkedIn, you've probably seen a

**[08:13]** on LinkedIn, you've probably seen a

**[08:13]** on LinkedIn, you've probably seen a thing or two about outcomebased pricing

**[08:15]** thing or two about outcomebased pricing

**[08:15]** thing or two about outcomebased pricing because I think it is very much actively

**[08:17]** because I think it is very much actively

**[08:18]** because I think it is very much actively being discussed and actively being

**[08:19]** being discussed and actively being

**[08:19]** being discussed and actively being explored. Maybe the hidden secret is

**[08:21]** explored. Maybe the hidden secret is

**[08:22]** explored. Maybe the hidden secret is that outside of this customer experience

**[08:23]** that outside of this customer experience

**[08:23]** that outside of this customer experience category, customer support space, it's

**[08:26]** category, customer support space, it's

**[08:26]** category, customer support space, it's really hard to find u many examples of

**[08:28]** really hard to find u many examples of

**[08:28]** really hard to find u many examples of this working really well quite yet. So

**[08:31]** this working really well quite yet. So

**[08:31]** this working really well quite yet. So perhaps this is still kind of more on

**[08:33]** perhaps this is still kind of more on

**[08:33]** perhaps this is still kind of more on the emerging side. And why is that?

**[08:35]** the emerging side. And why is that?

**[08:35]** the emerging side. And why is that? Because ultimately customer and vendor

**[08:38]** Because ultimately customer and vendor

**[08:38]** Because ultimately customer and vendor need to align on what the definition of

**[08:39]** need to align on what the definition of

**[08:39]** need to align on what the definition of the outcome is and need to furthermore

**[08:42]** the outcome is and need to furthermore

**[08:42]** the outcome is and need to furthermore be able to measure it in a somewhat

**[08:45]** be able to measure it in a somewhat

**[08:45]** be able to measure it in a somewhat objective way. So when you're dealing

**[08:47]** objective way. So when you're dealing

**[08:47]** objective way. So when you're dealing with a customer support ticket

**[08:48]** with a customer support ticket

**[08:48]** with a customer support ticket interaction that's very clear and

**[08:49]** interaction that's very clear and

**[08:49]** interaction that's very clear and simple, you can ask, hey, did this

**[08:51]** simple, you can ask, hey, did this

**[08:52]** simple, you can ask, hey, did this resolve your question? And you can see

**[08:53]** resolve your question? And you can see

**[08:53]** resolve your question? And you can see whether this needed to be escalated. But

**[08:55]** whether this needed to be escalated. But

**[08:55]** whether this needed to be escalated. But whenever you're trying to proxy things

**[08:56]** whenever you're trying to proxy things

**[08:56]** whenever you're trying to proxy things that are maybe more um creative or


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** that are maybe more um creative or

**[09:00]** that are maybe more um creative or perhaps more um you know less directly

**[09:03]** perhaps more um you know less directly

**[09:03]** perhaps more um you know less directly tied to uh dollars and cents as as can

**[09:06]** tied to uh dollars and cents as as can

**[09:06]** tied to uh dollars and cents as as can be measured by the cost that support

**[09:08]** be measured by the cost that support

**[09:08]** be measured by the cost that support teams incur for businesses that's that's

**[09:11]** teams incur for businesses that's that's

**[09:11]** teams incur for businesses that's that's been a little harder. So ultimately what

**[09:13]** been a little harder. So ultimately what

**[09:13]** been a little harder. So ultimately what I find very inspiring and exciting about

**[09:15]** I find very inspiring and exciting about

**[09:15]** I find very inspiring and exciting about outcomebased pricing is that it's not a

**[09:17]** outcomebased pricing is that it's not a

**[09:17]** outcomebased pricing is that it's not a proxy for ROI. It's literally ROI. So I

**[09:21]** proxy for ROI. It's literally ROI. So I

**[09:21]** proxy for ROI. It's literally ROI. So I think as an industry this year and and

**[09:23]** think as an industry this year and and

**[09:23]** think as an industry this year and and and for many years thereafter I think

**[09:25]** and for many years thereafter I think

**[09:25]** and for many years thereafter I think we're going to continue trying to find

**[09:26]** we're going to continue trying to find

**[09:26]** we're going to continue trying to find ways to crack this code and find um the

**[09:30]** ways to crack this code and find um the

**[09:30]** ways to crack this code and find um the right way to align outcomes and measure

**[09:32]** right way to align outcomes and measure

**[09:32]** right way to align outcomes and measure outcomes such that um this aligns with

**[09:35]** outcomes such that um this aligns with

**[09:35]** outcomes such that um this aligns with everybody.

**[09:36]** everybody.

**[09:36]** everybody. So lastly having explored like a couple

**[09:38]** So lastly having explored like a couple

**[09:38]** So lastly having explored like a couple of frameworks and ideas for how to price

**[09:41]** of frameworks and ideas for how to price

**[09:41]** of frameworks and ideas for how to price uh I think what's really important is to

**[09:43]** uh I think what's really important is to

**[09:43]** uh I think what's really important is to build a muscle around thinking about

**[09:45]** build a muscle around thinking about

**[09:45]** build a muscle around thinking about pricing strategy as something that needs

**[09:47]** pricing strategy as something that needs

**[09:47]** pricing strategy as something that needs continual evolution and experimentation.

**[09:50]** continual evolution and experimentation.

**[09:50]** continual evolution and experimentation. Maybe 10 years ago when we were building

**[09:52]** Maybe 10 years ago when we were building

**[09:52]** Maybe 10 years ago when we were building SAS, what we could do is like ship a

**[09:54]** SAS, what we could do is like ship a

**[09:54]** SAS, what we could do is like ship a product, pick or guess a price point and

**[09:57]** product, pick or guess a price point and

**[09:57]** product, pick or guess a price point and then spend, you know, a year, two years,

**[09:59]** then spend, you know, a year, two years,

**[09:59]** then spend, you know, a year, two years, three years building and adding value to


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:01]** three years building and adding value to

**[10:01]** three years building and adding value to that product and then we might realize

**[10:03]** that product and then we might realize

**[10:03]** that product and then we might realize like, oh, you know, you know what, we

**[10:04]** like, oh, you know, you know what, we

**[10:04]** like, oh, you know, you know what, we actually have to catch up to all this

**[10:06]** actually have to catch up to all this

**[10:06]** actually have to catch up to all this value that we've created and and think

**[10:08]** value that we've created and and think

**[10:08]** value that we've created and and think about doing a big large painful um price

**[10:10]** about doing a big large painful um price

**[10:10]** about doing a big large painful um price increase. But nowadays with AI when um

**[10:14]** increase. But nowadays with AI when um

**[10:14]** increase. But nowadays with AI when um you know new model drops can reduce cost

**[10:17]** you know new model drops can reduce cost

**[10:17]** you know new model drops can reduce cost by 10x or increase cost by 10x literally

**[10:20]** by 10x or increase cost by 10x literally

**[10:20]** by 10x or increase cost by 10x literally overnight like cloud 4 did I think this

**[10:24]** overnight like cloud 4 did I think this

**[10:24]** overnight like cloud 4 did I think this uh kind of one two threeear cycle of

**[10:26]** uh kind of one two threeear cycle of

**[10:26]** uh kind of one two threeear cycle of pricing iteration just doesn't cut it

**[10:28]** pricing iteration just doesn't cut it

**[10:28]** pricing iteration just doesn't cut it anymore. So what we see is that the best

**[10:30]** anymore. So what we see is that the best

**[10:30]** anymore. So what we see is that the best teams out there are able to find ways to

**[10:33]** teams out there are able to find ways to

**[10:33]** teams out there are able to find ways to um really drive a lot of experiment

**[10:35]** um really drive a lot of experiment

**[10:35]** um really drive a lot of experiment experimentation and continual evolution

**[10:37]** experimentation and continual evolution

**[10:37]** experimentation and continual evolution in their pricing.

**[10:39]** in their pricing.

**[10:39]** in their pricing. And as we've been talking about pricing

**[10:41]** And as we've been talking about pricing

**[10:41]** And as we've been talking about pricing strategy, I think it's important to

**[10:42]** strategy, I think it's important to

**[10:42]** strategy, I think it's important to remember that it all comes down to not

**[10:44]** remember that it all comes down to not

**[10:44]** remember that it all comes down to not just the price point, but rather the

**[10:46]** just the price point, but rather the

**[10:46]** just the price point, but rather the cohesive entire experience around

**[10:48]** cohesive entire experience around

**[10:48]** cohesive entire experience around pricing. Everything from how you package

### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:02]** contributes to that overall alignment of

**[11:02]** contributes to that overall alignment of price to value and should be something

**[11:03]** price to value and should be something

**[11:08]** should be continually experimenting

**[11:08]** should be continually experimenting around.

**[11:12]** So, how is this actually done and and

**[11:12]** So, how is this actually done and and and how are we finding um how are we

**[11:16]** and how are we finding um how are we

**[11:16]** and how are we finding um how are we helping teams do this? I wanted to share

**[11:19]** helping teams do this? I wanted to share

**[11:19]** helping teams do this? I wanted to share a little demo with you of Orb

**[11:21]** a little demo with you of Orb

**[11:21]** a little demo with you of Orb Simulations which is a product that

**[11:23]** Simulations which is a product that

**[11:23]** Simulations which is a product that we've built in around this idea of

**[11:26]** we've built in around this idea of

**[11:26]** we've built in around this idea of helping um customers find their right AI

**[11:29]** helping um customers find their right AI

**[11:29]** helping um customers find their right AI pricing strategies. So, let me tell you

**[11:31]** pricing strategies. So, let me tell you

**[11:31]** pricing strategies. So, let me tell you a little bit of a story here for

**[11:32]** a little bit of a story here for

**[11:32]** a little bit of a story here for context. This is Orb. We are connected

**[11:36]** context. This is Orb. We are connected

**[11:36]** context. This is Orb. We are connected and integrated with a raw and real-time

**[11:38]** and integrated with a raw and real-time

**[11:38]** and integrated with a raw and real-time stream of product usage events where

**[11:41]** stream of product usage events where

**[11:41]** stream of product usage events where what you're measuring and instrumenting

**[11:43]** what you're measuring and instrumenting

**[11:43]** what you're measuring and instrumenting in your application you can send into

**[11:44]** in your application you can send into

**[11:44]** in your application you can send into orb for billing and you know we've

**[11:47]** orb for billing and you know we've

**[11:47]** orb for billing and you know we've created a very flexible billing offering

**[11:49]** created a very flexible billing offering

**[11:49]** created a very flexible billing offering where um where like folks can come come

**[11:52]** where um where like folks can come come

**[11:52]** where um where like folks can come come in and um be able to like monitor in

**[11:57]** in and um be able to like monitor in

**[11:57]** in and um be able to like monitor in real time what their acred costs are and

**[11:59]** real time what their acred costs are and

**[11:59]** real time what their acred costs are and get a sense of um how much chargers our


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:02]** get a sense of um how much chargers our

**[12:02]** get a sense of um how much chargers our customers racking up. So again, this

**[12:04]** customers racking up. So again, this

**[12:04]** customers racking up. So again, this this idea is like the marriage of an

**[12:06]** this idea is like the marriage of an

**[12:06]** this idea is like the marriage of an analytics product with a billing product

**[12:08]** analytics product with a billing product

**[12:08]** analytics product with a billing product connected together to really drive a lot

**[12:10]** connected together to really drive a lot

**[12:10]** connected together to really drive a lot of that real-time insights.

**[12:13]** of that real-time insights.

**[12:13]** of that real-time insights. But last uh last year in in about the

**[12:17]** But last uh last year in in about the

**[12:17]** But last uh last year in in about the last six months, what we were noticing

**[12:19]** last six months, what we were noticing

**[12:19]** last six months, what we were noticing was a lot of our customers were using

**[12:21]** was a lot of our customers were using

**[12:21]** was a lot of our customers were using our product in a little bit of an

**[12:22]** our product in a little bit of an

**[12:22]** our product in a little bit of an unexpected way. What they were doing is

**[12:24]** unexpected way. What they were doing is

**[12:24]** unexpected way. What they were doing is they were sending data into Orb and then

**[12:26]** they were sending data into Orb and then

**[12:26]** they were sending data into Orb and then they were setting up shell pricing

**[12:28]** they were setting up shell pricing

**[12:28]** they were setting up shell pricing structures on top of that data, but not

**[12:30]** structures on top of that data, but not

**[12:30]** structures on top of that data, but not actually billing their customers for it.

**[12:33]** actually billing their customers for it.

**[12:33]** actually billing their customers for it. and we didn't understand why they were

**[12:35]** and we didn't understand why they were

**[12:36]** and we didn't understand why they were doing that. So, we called a few of them

**[12:37]** doing that. So, we called a few of them

**[12:37]** doing that. So, we called a few of them up and turns out that they were running

**[12:40]** up and turns out that they were running

**[12:40]** up and turns out that they were running the closed beta periods of a few

**[12:43]** the closed beta periods of a few

**[12:43]** the closed beta periods of a few upcoming product launches and several of

**[12:45]** upcoming product launches and several of

**[12:45]** upcoming product launches and several of those were the the closed beta periods

**[12:47]** those were the the closed beta periods

**[12:47]** those were the the closed beta periods of uh AI agent products coming out to

**[12:50]** of uh AI agent products coming out to

**[12:50]** of uh AI agent products coming out to market. So these teams had a product

**[12:52]** market. So these teams had a product

**[12:52]** market. So these teams had a product build. They had a group of customers

**[12:54]** build. They had a group of customers

**[12:54]** build. They had a group of customers that they they wanted to start to get

**[12:56]** that they they wanted to start to get

**[12:56]** that they they wanted to start to get feedback from but weren't fully pencils

**[12:59]** feedback from but weren't fully pencils

**[12:59]** feedback from but weren't fully pencils down on what exactly was the right


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:01]** down on what exactly was the right

**[13:01]** down on what exactly was the right pricing strategy and they were trying to

**[13:03]** pricing strategy and they were trying to

**[13:03]** pricing strategy and they were trying to hack orb into figuring that out. So what

**[13:06]** hack orb into figuring that out. So what

**[13:06]** hack orb into figuring that out. So what we did is we built a whole product

**[13:07]** we did is we built a whole product

**[13:07]** we did is we built a whole product experience around helping that that

**[13:09]** experience around helping that that

**[13:09]** experience around helping that that workflow. So what simulations let you

**[13:11]** workflow. So what simulations let you

**[13:11]** workflow. So what simulations let you lets you do is back test or or or test

**[13:14]** lets you do is back test or or or test

**[13:14]** lets you do is back test or or or test out alternate pricing strategies on top

**[13:17]** out alternate pricing strategies on top

**[13:17]** out alternate pricing strategies on top of that data platform of of product

**[13:19]** of that data platform of of product

**[13:19]** of that data platform of of product usage. And it's designed to help teams

**[13:22]** usage. And it's designed to help teams

**[13:22]** usage. And it's designed to help teams really answer that what if question.

**[13:23]** really answer that what if question.

**[13:23]** really answer that what if question. What if we tried pricing in that way or

**[13:25]** What if we tried pricing in that way or

**[13:25]** What if we tried pricing in that way or what if we experimented with a different

**[13:27]** what if we experimented with a different

**[13:27]** what if we experimented with a different model? Let me show you how that works.

**[13:29]** model? Let me show you how that works.

**[13:29]** model? Let me show you how that works. So in Orb, you can come in and define a

**[13:31]** So in Orb, you can come in and define a

**[13:31]** So in Orb, you can come in and define a simulation. So maybe for our our demo

**[13:34]** simulation. So maybe for our our demo

**[13:34]** simulation. So maybe for our our demo over here, we're going to pick a

**[13:36]** over here, we're going to pick a

**[13:36]** over here, we're going to pick a simulation time period that perhaps is

**[13:38]** simulation time period that perhaps is

**[13:38]** simulation time period that perhaps is going to span the period of our closed

**[13:40]** going to span the period of our closed

**[13:40]** going to span the period of our closed beta. And we're going to pick a cohort

**[13:42]** beta. And we're going to pick a cohort

**[13:42]** beta. And we're going to pick a cohort of customers. This might be just

**[13:45]** of customers. This might be just

**[13:45]** of customers. This might be just customers that are not yet paying in

**[13:46]** customers that are not yet paying in

**[13:46]** customers that are not yet paying in that closed beta period or might even be

**[13:48]** that closed beta period or might even be

**[13:48]** that closed beta period or might even be a group of existing customers that are

**[13:51]** a group of existing customers that are

**[13:51]** a group of existing customers that are um paying for a previous or older

**[13:53]** um paying for a previous or older

**[13:53]** um paying for a previous or older version of of your pricing and that

**[13:55]** version of of your pricing and that

**[13:55]** version of of your pricing and that they're about to get uh a new kind of

**[13:57]** they're about to get uh a new kind of

**[13:58]** they're about to get uh a new kind of value. And what we enable you to do is


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** value. And what we enable you to do is

**[14:00]** value. And what we enable you to do is to build out scenarios for alternate

**[14:02]** to build out scenarios for alternate

**[14:02]** to build out scenarios for alternate ways to price. So maybe we can start

**[14:04]** ways to price. So maybe we can start

**[14:04]** ways to price. So maybe we can start with our baseline and what we're going

**[14:07]** with our baseline and what we're going

**[14:07]** with our baseline and what we're going to do is try more of an add-on based

**[14:09]** to do is try more of an add-on based

**[14:09]** to do is try more of an add-on based pricing strategy where what we'll do is

**[14:11]** pricing strategy where what we'll do is

**[14:11]** pricing strategy where what we'll do is um uh maybe come in and say we want to

**[14:15]** um uh maybe come in and say we want to

**[14:15]** um uh maybe come in and say we want to add a fixed fee. We're going to charge

**[14:17]** add a fixed fee. We're going to charge

**[14:17]** add a fixed fee. We're going to charge everybody $20 for um AI agent access.

**[14:21]** everybody $20 for um AI agent access.

**[14:21]** everybody $20 for um AI agent access. Alternatively, we might want to add a

**[14:24]** Alternatively, we might want to add a

**[14:24]** Alternatively, we might want to add a more uh granular or discrete pricing

**[14:26]** more uh granular or discrete pricing

**[14:26]** more uh granular or discrete pricing strategy where we can come in and

**[14:28]** strategy where we can come in and

**[14:28]** strategy where we can come in and actually charge for tokens. And perhaps

**[14:31]** actually charge for tokens. And perhaps

**[14:31]** actually charge for tokens. And perhaps for those tokens, we want to charge a

**[14:33]** for those tokens, we want to charge a

**[14:33]** for those tokens, we want to charge a simple unit price or maybe more of a

**[14:35]** simple unit price or maybe more of a

**[14:35]** simple unit price or maybe more of a tiered fee where some tokens come

**[14:37]** tiered fee where some tokens come

**[14:37]** tiered fee where some tokens come included for free um and others are

**[14:40]** included for free um and others are

**[14:40]** included for free um and others are charged on top of that. Again, the idea

**[14:42]** charged on top of that. Again, the idea

**[14:42]** charged on top of that. Again, the idea here is to really help you build a

**[14:44]** here is to really help you build a

**[14:44]** here is to really help you build a different set of pricing possibilities

**[14:47]** different set of pricing possibilities

**[14:47]** different set of pricing possibilities so that you can help answer your ideas

**[14:49]** so that you can help answer your ideas

**[14:49]** so that you can help answer your ideas about how to price in a rich data

**[14:51]** about how to price in a rich data

**[14:51]** about how to price in a rich data informed way. So when we run that

**[14:53]** informed way. So when we run that

**[14:54]** informed way. So when we run that simulation, what we'll generate is a

**[14:56]** simulation, what we'll generate is a

**[14:56]** simulation, what we'll generate is a report that shows you uh a lot of

**[14:58]** report that shows you uh a lot of

**[14:58]** report that shows you uh a lot of insights and and and angle points into


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:02]** insights and and and angle points into

**[15:02]** insights and and and angle points into this decision of how you should price.

**[15:04]** this decision of how you should price.

**[15:04]** this decision of how you should price. So first and foremost, between these

**[15:06]** So first and foremost, between these

**[15:06]** So first and foremost, between these scenarios that we've outlined, we'll

**[15:08]** scenarios that we've outlined, we'll

**[15:08]** scenarios that we've outlined, we'll show you what the biggest impact to

**[15:10]** show you what the biggest impact to

**[15:10]** show you what the biggest impact to topline revenue is. So you can kind of

**[15:11]** topline revenue is. So you can kind of

**[15:11]** topline revenue is. So you can kind of understand based on the actual

**[15:13]** understand based on the actual

**[15:13]** understand based on the actual consumption usage patterns of your

**[15:15]** consumption usage patterns of your

**[15:15]** consumption usage patterns of your customers, uh which uh pricing scenario

**[15:17]** customers, uh which uh pricing scenario

**[15:18]** customers, uh which uh pricing scenario might u be the most effective one. But

**[15:21]** might u be the most effective one. But

**[15:21]** might u be the most effective one. But if anybody who's lived in this world

**[15:23]** if anybody who's lived in this world

**[15:23]** if anybody who's lived in this world knows and understands that it's not just

**[15:25]** knows and understands that it's not just

**[15:25]** knows and understands that it's not just about topline revenue when you're

**[15:27]** about topline revenue when you're

**[15:27]** about topline revenue when you're dealing with existing customers that are

**[15:29]** dealing with existing customers that are

**[15:29]** dealing with existing customers that are paying you a certain way or a certain

**[15:30]** paying you a certain way or a certain

**[15:30]** paying you a certain way or a certain amount, it's kind of hard just to hike

**[15:33]** amount, it's kind of hard just to hike

**[15:33]** amount, it's kind of hard just to hike up pricing on them. So getting an

**[15:35]** up pricing on them. So getting an

**[15:35]** up pricing on them. So getting an understanding of what the lowest average

**[15:37]** understanding of what the lowest average

**[15:37]** understanding of what the lowest average change to existing customers will be is

**[15:40]** change to existing customers will be is

**[15:40]** change to existing customers will be is also really important. And so what we

**[15:42]** also really important. And so what we

**[15:42]** also really important. And so what we give you is a very detailed view into

**[15:44]** give you is a very detailed view into

**[15:44]** give you is a very detailed view into the revenue mix that you might expect

**[15:46]** the revenue mix that you might expect

**[15:46]** the revenue mix that you might expect based on a particular pricing strategy

**[15:48]** based on a particular pricing strategy

**[15:48]** based on a particular pricing strategy and even a scatter plot that shows you

**[15:50]** and even a scatter plot that shows you

**[15:50]** and even a scatter plot that shows you like percentage magnitude change as well

**[15:52]** like percentage magnitude change as well

**[15:52]** like percentage magnitude change as well as revenue impact for different

**[15:53]** as revenue impact for different

**[15:53]** as revenue impact for different customers. Uh obviously with with an

**[15:55]** customers. Uh obviously with with an

**[15:55]** customers. Uh obviously with with an exportable data set of impact to each

**[15:58]** exportable data set of impact to each

**[15:58]** exportable data set of impact to each individual customers. I think the big


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:00]** individual customers. I think the big

**[16:00]** individual customers. I think the big idea here is to break through a lot of

**[16:03]** idea here is to break through a lot of

**[16:03]** idea here is to break through a lot of this fear, uncertainty and doubt of how

**[16:05]** this fear, uncertainty and doubt of how

**[16:05]** this fear, uncertainty and doubt of how should I price with data and help teams

**[16:09]** should I price with data and help teams

**[16:09]** should I price with data and help teams uh you know if you will travel time or

**[16:12]** uh you know if you will travel time or

**[16:12]** uh you know if you will travel time or or really help explore the space of

**[16:14]** or really help explore the space of

**[16:14]** or really help explore the space of pricing possibilities so that when you

**[16:16]** pricing possibilities so that when you

**[16:16]** pricing possibilities so that when you get to that moment where you're ready to

**[16:18]** get to that moment where you're ready to

**[16:18]** get to that moment where you're ready to launch you're doing so very confidently

**[16:21]** launch you're doing so very confidently

**[16:21]** launch you're doing so very confidently and with certainty of what that impact

**[16:23]** and with certainty of what that impact

**[16:23]** and with certainty of what that impact is going to be to your existing customer

**[16:25]** is going to be to your existing customer

**[16:25]** is going to be to your existing customer base. So that's Orb simulations and

**[16:27]** base. So that's Orb simulations and

**[16:27]** base. So that's Orb simulations and again really the idea here is if we

**[16:30]** again really the idea here is if we

**[16:30]** again really the idea here is if we really want want to help you not have to

**[16:32]** really want want to help you not have to

**[16:32]** really want want to help you not have to price on vibes or uh ideally will give

**[16:35]** price on vibes or uh ideally will give

**[16:35]** price on vibes or uh ideally will give you some tools and our perspective is

**[16:37]** you some tools and our perspective is

**[16:37]** you some tools and our perspective is that um uh AI builders should always

**[16:41]** that um uh AI builders should always

**[16:41]** that um uh AI builders should always simulate first before putting something

**[16:43]** simulate first before putting something

**[16:43]** simulate first before putting something out to market

**[16:45]** out to market

**[16:45]** out to market to close up over here you know we've

**[16:47]** to close up over here you know we've

**[16:47]** to close up over here you know we've explored some uh ideas around how to

**[16:49]** explored some uh ideas around how to

**[16:49]** explored some uh ideas around how to price first of all thinking about should

**[16:52]** price first of all thinking about should

**[16:52]** price first of all thinking about should you even monetize directly or indirectly

**[16:55]** you even monetize directly or indirectly

**[16:55]** you even monetize directly or indirectly then explor explored the value metric

**[16:56]** then explor explored the value metric

**[16:56]** then explor explored the value metric selection question. Just making sure

**[16:59]** selection question. Just making sure

**[16:59]** selection question. Just making sure that the way your pricing really aligns


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:01]** that the way your pricing really aligns

**[17:01]** that the way your pricing really aligns to the value that you want your

**[17:03]** to the value that you want your

**[17:03]** to the value that you want your customers to perceive from your product

**[17:05]** customers to perceive from your product

**[17:05]** customers to perceive from your product and to incent the behavior that you want

**[17:07]** and to incent the behavior that you want

**[17:08]** and to incent the behavior that you want them to to take. And then thirdly, um

**[17:11]** them to to take. And then thirdly, um

**[17:11]** them to to take. And then thirdly, um really explored how uh experimentation

**[17:15]** really explored how uh experimentation

**[17:15]** really explored how uh experimentation and thinking about pricing evolution in

**[17:17]** and thinking about pricing evolution in

**[17:17]** and thinking about pricing evolution in a continual way is not just valuable but

**[17:20]** a continual way is not just valuable but

**[17:20]** a continual way is not just valuable but really critical and important um for for

**[17:22]** really critical and important um for for

**[17:22]** really critical and important um for for these kind of AI products. So, you might

**[17:25]** these kind of AI products. So, you might

**[17:25]** these kind of AI products. So, you might be thinking that this is um hard or

**[17:28]** be thinking that this is um hard or

**[17:28]** be thinking that this is um hard or tricky. Well, it is hard or tricky, but

**[17:31]** tricky. Well, it is hard or tricky, but

**[17:31]** tricky. Well, it is hard or tricky, but uh what we've seen with our customers is

**[17:32]** uh what we've seen with our customers is

**[17:32]** uh what we've seen with our customers is that they've been able to achieve truly

**[17:35]** that they've been able to achieve truly

**[17:35]** that they've been able to achieve truly headline inspiring results on their

**[17:36]** headline inspiring results on their

**[17:36]** headline inspiring results on their revenue front and get their amazing

**[17:38]** revenue front and get their amazing

**[17:38]** revenue front and get their amazing products to the right audiences by

**[17:41]** products to the right audiences by

**[17:41]** products to the right audiences by finding that uh aligned and and and

**[17:43]** finding that uh aligned and and and

**[17:43]** finding that uh aligned and and and correct pricing strategy. Um, and we've

**[17:46]** correct pricing strategy. Um, and we've

**[17:46]** correct pricing strategy. Um, and we've really been able to see up close that

**[17:49]** really been able to see up close that

**[17:49]** really been able to see up close that when you can get it right or when you

**[17:51]** when you can get it right or when you

**[17:51]** when you can get it right or when you can converge to write, the impact can be

**[17:53]** can converge to write, the impact can be

**[17:53]** can converge to write, the impact can be huge and uh, valuable.

**[17:56]** huge and uh, valuable.

**[17:56]** huge and uh, valuable. We are going to be hanging out today on

**[18:05]** products out to market or if you want

**[18:05]** products out to market or if you want more data points or ideas about how

**[18:07]** more data points or ideas about how

**[18:07]** more data points or ideas about how folks are thinking about AI pricing, um,

**[18:09]** folks are thinking about AI pricing, um,
