## Executive Summary

Dani Grant (founder of Jam) and Chelcie Taylor (VC at Notable Capital) deliver an interactive workshop on fundraising for AI engineers. They debunk common myths about what you need to raise VC (spoiler: you don't need revenue or even a product), share real examples of cold emails that work vs. don't work, explain the VC mindset and power law dynamics, provide tactical advice on building investor relationships, and offer guidance on pitch decks, valuation, and equity splits. The session is particularly valuable for technical founders who are new to the fundraising process.

## Topics

### [Introduction & Prerequisites for Raising VC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=0s)
**Timestamp:** 00:00 - 05:00

- **Do you need revenue to raise VC?** No - pre-seed and seed funds invest in companies pre-revenue and sometimes pre-product
- **Do you need a product?** No - investors at the earliest stages are betting on you as a founder, your team, and your vision
- **Do you need to leave your full-time job?** Mixed - some firms are comfortable with side projects, but leaving your job signals conviction
- **Dani's spicy take:** It's easier to raise when everything is "potential" rather than having a mediocre product
- **"Ask for advice, get money. Ask for money, get advice"** - Build relationships before you're officially fundraising
- **Do you need a co-founder?** Typically yes - most VC-backed businesses have co-founders, though solo founders exist

**Key insight:** Early-stage investors back the founder and vision, not the current product. The product will likely look dramatically different in 7-10 years.

### [Getting to VCs: Cold Emails & Warm Intros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=300s)
**Timestamp:** 05:00 - 10:00

- **VCs do read cold emails** - but the ones that get answered usually have some "warm signal"
- **Best approach:** Engage with VC content on LinkedIn, then reach out referencing their posts
- **Ask for 15 minutes early** - casual conversations before you're "running a process" work better

**Real cold email examples analyzed:**

**Email #1 (GOOD):** "Hi, it was great meeting you at [event]. My co-founders and I are taking time off from [company] to build [thing]. We've built an MVP and started beta testing. I'd love your take on our go-to-market and any pointers to other investors. Do you have 15-20 minutes to chat?"
- ✅ Shows traction (MVP, beta testing)
- ✅ Specific ask (15-20 minutes)
- ✅ References prior meeting
- ✅ Asks for advice, not money

**Email #2 (BAD):** "Hey, I loved your post about AI. We're building something cool in this space. Would love to connect!"
- ❌ Too vague
- ❌ No specifics about what they're building
- ❌ No clear ask or value proposition

### [Understanding VC Psychology & Power Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=600s)
**Timestamp:** 10:00 - 15:00

- **VCs are salespeople** - they're trying to sell money to amazing entrepreneurs
- **Power law dynamics:** VCs need companies that can return the entire fund
  - If a fund is $100M, they need a company that can generate a $100M return
  - This means aiming for billion-dollar outcomes, not $10M exits
- **VCs want conviction** - they look for founders who are "all in" and believe deeply in what they're building
- **Relationship before transaction** - The best deals come from relationships built over time

**Key quote from Chelcie:** "I'm constantly on LinkedIn putting out content 2-3 times a week on topics I'm thinking about. Entrepreneurs who reach out saying 'Hey, I'm building something relevant, want to spend 15 minutes to chat?' - I almost always reply and hop on the phone."

### [More Cold Email Examples: What Works & What Doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=900s)
**Timestamp:** 15:00 - 20:00

**Email #3 (MEDIOCRE):** Long, detailed technical description of the product
- ❌ Too much detail upfront
- ❌ Doesn't lead with the problem or market opportunity
- ✅ Shows technical depth (good for engineer investors)

**Email #4 (GOOD):** "We're solving [specific problem] for [specific customer]. Early customers include [name-drop]. Looking to raise [$X] to [specific milestone]. Would love 20 minutes to get your feedback."
- ✅ Clear problem statement
- ✅ Social proof (customers/name-drops)
- ✅ Specific funding ask and use of funds
- ✅ Humble ask for feedback

**Best practices:**
- Keep it under 5 sentences
- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- Include social proof if you have it
- Make a specific, low-commitment ask
- Reference something that makes it "warm" (their content, a mutual connection, etc.)

### [The Fundraising Process & Timeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=1200s)
**Timestamp:** 20:00 - 25:00

- **Start relationships 6-12 months before you need money**
- **The "official process" takes 2-3 months** once you kick it off
- **Steps in the process:**
  1. Initial meeting (30-60 minutes)
  2. Follow-up deep dive (often multiple meetings)
  3. Partner meeting (presenting to the full partnership)
  4. Due diligence (reference calls, technical validation)
  5. Term sheet
  6. Legal docs and closing

- **Common mistake:** Starting too late - "I need money in 30 days"
- **Best approach:** Build relationships early, then when you're ready to raise, you already have investors who know and believe in you

**Dani's experience:** Started conversations with VCs before they had a product, when everything was "potential" - made fundraising easier

### [Pitch Deck Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=1500s)
**Timestamp:** 25:00 - 29:00

**What to include:**
1. **Problem** - What sucks about the world today?
2. **Solution** - Your unique insight/approach
3. **Why now?** - What's changed that makes this possible today?
4. **Market size** - TAM/SAM/SOM
5. **Traction** - What have you accomplished? (customers, revenue, growth metrics)
6. **Team** - Why are you uniquely positioned to win?
7. **Competition** - Who else is trying to solve this? Why will you win?
8. **Business model** - How will you make money?
9. **Ask** - How much are you raising and what will you use it for?

**Common mistakes:**
- Too many slides (keep it to 10-15)
- Too technical upfront (save deep tech for follow-up meetings)
- Burying the lead (put the most compelling stuff first)
- No clear ask

**Pro tip:** Send the deck before the meeting so investors can review it, then use the meeting for Q&A and relationship building

### [Valuation, Equity & Deal Terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=1740s)
**Timestamp:** 29:00 - 32:00

- **Pre-seed/seed valuations** vary widely based on market conditions, traction, and team
  - Pre-seed: typically $5-15M post-money valuation
  - Seed: typically $15-40M post-money valuation

- **How much to raise?**
  - Aim for 18-24 months of runway
  - Calculate backwards: What milestones do you need to hit to raise the next round?

- **Dilution:**
  - Pre-seed: typically 10-15% dilution
  - Seed: typically 15-20% dilution
  - Aim to keep founder ownership above 60-70% after early rounds

- **Key terms beyond valuation:**
  - Board composition
  - Protective provisions
  - Pro-rata rights
  - Option pool size

**Advice:** Don't over-optimize for valuation - the right partner who can help you build is worth more than a few extra percentage points

### [Q&A Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYNXFsUutbM&t=1920s)
**Timestamp:** 32:00 - 35:00

**Q: How do you know if a VC is the right fit?**
- Talk to their portfolio companies (especially failed ones)
- Understand their fund stage and check size
- Look for value-add beyond capital (network, expertise, etc.)

**Q: What if you don't have a warm intro?**
- Engage with VC content on social media
- Attend events where VCs speak
- Use the "ask for advice" approach early
- Be persistent but respectful

**Q: How much traction do you really need?**
- For pre-seed: strong vision + team is often enough
- For seed: some product and early customer validation
- For Series A: Product-market fit signals (revenue, retention, growth)

**Final advice:** Start building relationships now, even if you're not fundraising for a year. The best deals come from founders VCs have watched and supported over time.
