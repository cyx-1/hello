### 4. Federous AI - Quorki 72B Model & Reliable AI Agents
**[07:28 - 10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=448s)**

- Built Quorki 72B: world's largest model without transformer attention
- Trained with only 8 GPUs
- 1000x lower inference cost while maintaining performance
- Technology applicable to existing transformers via speculative decoding
- **Hot take: "Scale is dead"** - focus should be on reliability, not just bigger models

- Built Action R1 agent that beats Claude Sonnet, Gemini, and OpenAI for form-filling tasks
- Focus on 99.9% reliability for boring tasks (booking tickets, emails, taxes) vs. PhD-level math

**Key insight:** Companies don't need smarter models for PhD math - they need reliable models for everyday tasks. Reliability is revenue.

### 5. Upside - Forensic Revenue Attribution
**[10:39 - 13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=639s)**

- Forensic revenue attribution and intelligence for sales/marketing teams
- Sales teams are "data hoarders" but not data practitioners
- Using LLMs to structure messy enterprise data (Salesforce as "SQL in a trench coat")
- Creating a "data command center" from unstructured business data
- Similar to how search engines made sense of unstructured web
- LinkedIn post announcing product "blew up" - significant demand from enterprises
- Working with major companies, still in building phase
- Founder dropped out of high school at 15, joined Branch (deep linking startup)
- Built search engine used by 100M+ people daily

**Key insight:** LLMs can transform enterprise data chaos into structured insights, similar to how search engines organized the web.

- Outranking ElevenLabs on TTS Arena
- ElevenLabs responded with new model (demo only) same day
- Built So-VITS-SVC v2 and Fish Speech (open source models)

**Key insight:** Current AI is "flat, emotionless, robotic" - the future is emotionally expressive AI you can fall in love with.
