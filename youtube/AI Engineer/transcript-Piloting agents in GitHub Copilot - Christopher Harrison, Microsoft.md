**[00:17]** So, uh, a couple of real quick things

**[00:17]** So, uh, a couple of real quick things for, uh, those who are just getting

**[00:18]** for, uh, those who are just getting

**[00:18]** for, uh, those who are just getting settled in or just rumming in. Um, first

**[00:20]** settled in or just rumming in. Um, first

**[00:20]** settled in or just rumming in. Um, first of all, if you're sitting in the back

**[00:21]** of all, if you're sitting in the back

**[00:21]** of all, if you're sitting in the back and hoping for a seat, um, it does look

**[00:23]** and hoping for a seat, um, it does look

**[00:23]** and hoping for a seat, um, it does look like we are, um, completely, um, full

**[00:26]** like we are, um, completely, um, full

**[00:26]** like we are, um, completely, um, full up. I can move my stuff here. We'll have

**[00:28]** up. I can move my stuff here. We'll have

**[00:28]** up. I can move my stuff here. We'll have a seat here. And I think that might be

**[00:31]** a seat here. And I think that might be

**[00:31]** a seat here. And I think that might be it. Now, having said that, uh, we are

**[00:34]** it. Now, having said that, uh, we are

**[00:34]** it. Now, having said that, uh, we are going to be, and I want to make sure

**[00:35]** going to be, and I want to make sure

**[00:35]** going to be, and I want to make sure that I'm clear about this. So, if you're

**[00:37]** that I'm clear about this. So, if you're

**[00:37]** that I'm clear about this. So, if you're working on something else, um, now is

**[00:38]** working on something else, um, now is

**[00:38]** working on something else, um, now is not the time to multitask. Um, but

**[00:40]** not the time to multitask. Um, but

**[00:40]** not the time to multitask. Um, but instead, pay attention to the person

**[00:42]** instead, pay attention to the person

**[00:42]** instead, pay attention to the person that's babbling up in the front of the

**[00:43]** that's babbling up in the front of the

**[00:43]** that's babbling up in the front of the room. Um,

**[00:46]** room. Um,

**[00:46]** room. Um, uh, we are going to be running the exact

**[00:50]** uh, we are going to be running the exact

**[00:50]** uh, we are going to be running the exact same lab. I'm going to say that one more

**[00:53]** same lab. I'm going to say that one more

**[00:53]** same lab. I'm going to say that one more time for effect. But we are going to be

**[00:55]** time for effect. But we are going to be

**[00:55]** time for effect. But we are going to be running the exact same lab this

**[00:58]** running the exact same lab this

**[00:58]** running the exact same lab this afternoon at 3:30. So even though that


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** afternoon at 3:30. So even though that

**[01:01]** afternoon at 3:30. So even though that 3:30 lab has a different title, a

**[01:03]** 3:30 lab has a different title, a

**[01:03]** 3:30 lab has a different title, a different abstract, I'm here to tell you

**[01:05]** different abstract, I'm here to tell you

**[01:05]** different abstract, I'm here to tell you it is the exact same lab. How do I know

**[01:07]** it is the exact same lab. How do I know

**[01:07]** it is the exact same lab. How do I know that? Because I'm going to be the one

**[01:09]** that? Because I'm going to be the one

**[01:09]** that? Because I'm going to be the one leading it.

**[01:11]** leading it.

**[01:30]** particular organization. That organization is going to give you access

**[01:31]** organization is going to give you access

**[01:31]** organization is going to give you access to GitHub copilot. Now, uh, when you get

**[01:35]** to GitHub copilot. Now, uh, when you get

**[01:35]** to GitHub copilot. Now, uh, when you get added into an organization in GitHub,

**[01:38]** added into an organization in GitHub,

**[01:38]** added into an organization in GitHub, you do need to accept that invitation.

**[01:42]** you do need to accept that invitation.

**[02:04]** time for those in the back of the room.

**[02:04]** time for those in the back of the room. If you want to do this lab, come on back

**[02:06]** If you want to do this lab, come on back

**[02:06]** If you want to do this lab, come on back at 3:30. We're going to be doing the

**[02:08]** at 3:30. We're going to be doing the

**[02:08]** at 3:30. We're going to be doing the exact same lab at 3:30. Okay. And I'll

**[02:12]** exact same lab at 3:30. Okay. And I'll

**[02:12]** exact same lab at 3:30. Okay. And I'll be back in just a minute.

**[02:19]** Um, in your email uh that you have

**[02:19]** Um, in your email uh that you have associated with your GitHub account.

**[02:33]** All right. So, here's what we're gonna

**[02:33]** All right. So, here's what we're gonna do.

**[02:43]** Oh, I can actually take.

**[02:43]** Oh, I can actually take. So there.

**[02:50]** Yeah, if we could get all devices

**[02:50]** Yeah, if we could get all devices silent, vibrate. If you get a phone

**[02:51]** silent, vibrate. If you get a phone

**[02:52]** silent, vibrate. If you get a phone call, more than a take that you're more

**[02:53]** call, more than a take that you're more

**[02:53]** call, more than a take that you're more than welcome to take that phone call

**[02:55]** than welcome to take that phone call

**[02:55]** than welcome to take that phone call behind outside those those doors there.

**[02:57]** behind outside those those doors there.

**[02:57]** behind outside those those doors there. Um, cool. So, while we are getting


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** Um, cool. So, while we are getting

**[03:00]** Um, cool. So, while we are getting everything um situated,

**[03:03]** everything um situated,

**[03:03]** everything um situated, um here's what I'm going to do is I am

**[03:06]** um here's what I'm going to do is I am

**[03:06]** um here's what I'm going to do is I am going to There we go. Um start tracking

**[03:10]** going to There we go. Um start tracking

**[03:10]** going to There we go. Um start tracking through this little thing called get up

**[03:12]** through this little thing called get up

**[03:12]** through this little thing called get up co-pilot and then uh begin to introduce

**[03:15]** co-pilot and then uh begin to introduce

**[03:15]** co-pilot and then uh begin to introduce the lab and then get you turned over to

**[03:17]** the lab and then get you turned over to

**[03:17]** the lab and then get you turned over to the first exercise. Basically, what's

**[03:19]** the first exercise. Basically, what's

**[03:19]** the first exercise. Basically, what's going to wind up happening is I'll do a

**[03:21]** going to wind up happening is I'll do a

**[03:21]** going to wind up happening is I'll do a little bit of babbling and then you'll

**[03:23]** little bit of babbling and then you'll

**[03:23]** little bit of babbling and then you'll do a little bit of work and then I'll do

**[03:25]** do a little bit of work and then I'll do

**[03:25]** do a little bit of work and then I'll do a little bit of more babbling and then

**[03:26]** a little bit of more babbling and then

**[03:26]** a little bit of more babbling and then lather, rinse, repeat until we have uh

**[03:29]** lather, rinse, repeat until we have uh

**[03:29]** lather, rinse, repeat until we have uh run out of time here. We have 73

**[03:31]** run out of time here. We have 73

**[03:31]** run out of time here. We have 73 minutes. Should be actually still able

**[03:33]** minutes. Should be actually still able

**[03:33]** minutes. Should be actually still able to get through the bulk of the lab or at

**[03:35]** to get through the bulk of the lab or at

**[03:35]** to get through the bulk of the lab or at the very least we'll be able to get

**[03:37]** the very least we'll be able to get

**[03:37]** the very least we'll be able to get through the cool parts of it. uh we

**[03:39]** through the cool parts of it. uh we

**[03:39]** through the cool parts of it. uh we might like skip something just so we can

**[03:41]** might like skip something just so we can

**[03:41]** might like skip something just so we can make sure that we can get to um uh to

**[03:43]** make sure that we can get to um uh to

**[03:44]** make sure that we can get to um uh to the end, but we'll explore and we'll

**[03:45]** the end, but we'll explore and we'll

**[03:45]** the end, but we'll explore and we'll play with all of that as we uh as we go

**[03:47]** play with all of that as we uh as we go

**[03:48]** play with all of that as we uh as we go here. So without any further ado, let's

**[03:50]** here. So without any further ado, let's

**[03:50]** here. So without any further ado, let's talk about this little thing called

**[03:52]** talk about this little thing called

**[03:52]** talk about this little thing called GitHub Copilot. If you're not already

**[03:54]** GitHub Copilot. If you're not already

**[03:54]** GitHub Copilot. If you're not already familiar with GitHub Copilot, uh GitHub

**[03:56]** familiar with GitHub Copilot, uh GitHub

**[03:56]** familiar with GitHub Copilot, uh GitHub Copilot has been given this tag of your

**[03:59]** Copilot has been given this tag of your

**[03:59]** Copilot has been given this tag of your AI pair programmer. Now, not only is


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:02]** AI pair programmer. Now, not only is

**[04:02]** AI pair programmer. Now, not only is that wonderful marketing because it is

**[04:05]** that wonderful marketing because it is

**[04:05]** that wonderful marketing because it is kind of wonderful marketing, um it's

**[04:07]** kind of wonderful marketing, um it's

**[04:07]** kind of wonderful marketing, um it's actually I think honestly the best way

**[04:09]** actually I think honestly the best way

**[04:09]** actually I think honestly the best way to describe and to think about GitHub

**[04:12]** to describe and to think about GitHub

**[04:12]** to describe and to think about GitHub copilot that just as I'm working with a

**[04:15]** copilot that just as I'm working with a

**[04:15]** copilot that just as I'm working with a pair programmer, I'm going to ask them

**[04:17]** pair programmer, I'm going to ask them

**[04:17]** pair programmer, I'm going to ask them to perform different tasks. I'm going to

**[04:18]** to perform different tasks. I'm going to

**[04:18]** to perform different tasks. I'm going to ask them to uh to do different things

**[04:20]** ask them to uh to do different things

**[04:20]** ask them to uh to do different things and we're going to work together. We're

**[04:22]** and we're going to work together. We're

**[04:22]** and we're going to work together. We're going to collaborate to build out a

**[04:24]** going to collaborate to build out a

**[04:24]** going to collaborate to build out a solution to solve problems. I'm going to

**[04:27]** solution to solve problems. I'm going to

**[04:27]** solution to solve problems. I'm going to do that exact same thing when we're

**[04:29]** do that exact same thing when we're

**[04:29]** do that exact same thing when we're talking about co-pilot. And just like an

**[04:32]** talking about co-pilot. And just like an

**[04:32]** talking about co-pilot. And just like an AI pair programmer, it's going to have

**[04:34]** AI pair programmer, it's going to have

**[04:34]** AI pair programmer, it's going to have certain strengths, gonna have certain

**[04:35]** certain strengths, gonna have certain

**[04:35]** certain strengths, gonna have certain weaknesses, and there are going to be

**[04:38]** weaknesses, and there are going to be

**[04:38]** weaknesses, and there are going to be specific workloads that it's going to be

**[04:41]** specific workloads that it's going to be

**[04:41]** specific workloads that it's going to be able to help out with. And that's

**[04:42]** able to help out with. And that's

**[04:42]** able to help out with. And that's exactly what we're going to see here

**[04:45]** exactly what we're going to see here

**[04:45]** exactly what we're going to see here that we're going to take a look at a

**[04:47]** that we're going to take a look at a

**[04:47]** that we're going to take a look at a couple of different modes with agent

**[04:48]** couple of different modes with agent

**[04:48]** couple of different modes with agent mode locally, with edit mode, with ask

**[04:50]** mode locally, with edit mode, with ask

**[04:50]** mode locally, with edit mode, with ask mode. We're also going to take a look at

**[04:53]** mode. We're also going to take a look at

**[04:53]** mode. We're also going to take a look at what we announced at Build, our brand

**[04:55]** what we announced at Build, our brand

**[04:55]** what we announced at Build, our brand new Copilot coding agent, which actually

**[04:57]** new Copilot coding agent, which actually

**[04:57]** new Copilot coding agent, which actually allows you to assign issues to Copilot.


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** allows you to assign issues to Copilot.

**[05:00]** allows you to assign issues to Copilot. And then we're also going to spend an

**[05:01]** And then we're also going to spend an

**[05:02]** And then we're also going to spend an awful lot of time talking about context

**[05:04]** awful lot of time talking about context

**[05:04]** awful lot of time talking about context because, as I mentioned again, AI pair

**[05:06]** because, as I mentioned again, AI pair

**[05:06]** because, as I mentioned again, AI pair programmer, context is really key. It's

**[05:09]** programmer, context is really key. It's

**[05:09]** programmer, context is really key. It's key across many aspects of life and it's

**[05:12]** key across many aspects of life and it's

**[05:12]** key across many aspects of life and it's certainly going to be key whenever we're

**[05:14]** certainly going to be key whenever we're

**[05:14]** certainly going to be key whenever we're working with any form of AI and that

**[05:17]** working with any form of AI and that

**[05:17]** working with any form of AI and that does include GitHub Copilot. So without

**[05:21]** does include GitHub Copilot. So without

**[05:21]** does include GitHub Copilot. So without any further delay, let's go ahead and

**[05:23]** any further delay, let's go ahead and

**[05:23]** any further delay, let's go ahead and get into it. Are you comfortable down

**[05:24]** get into it. Are you comfortable down

**[05:24]** get into it. Are you comfortable down there, John? All right. Okay.

**[05:29]** there, John? All right. Okay.

**[05:29]** there, John? All right. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about context.

**[05:32]** Let's talk a little bit about context.

**[05:32]** Let's talk a little bit about context. And the way that I always like to

**[05:34]** And the way that I always like to

**[05:34]** And the way that I always like to introduce context is by um giving uh a

**[05:38]** introduce context is by um giving uh a

**[05:38]** introduce context is by um giving uh a little bit of of a quick story that uh

**[05:41]** little bit of of a quick story that uh

**[05:41]** little bit of of a quick story that uh my partner and I woke up the other day.

**[05:43]** my partner and I woke up the other day.

**[05:43]** my partner and I woke up the other day. She looks at me and says, "Let's go get

**[05:45]** She looks at me and says, "Let's go get

**[05:45]** She looks at me and says, "Let's go get brunch." Fantastic. Who doesn't love

**[05:47]** brunch." Fantastic. Who doesn't love

**[05:47]** brunch." Fantastic. Who doesn't love brunch? And so I recommended a spot. And

**[05:50]** brunch? And so I recommended a spot. And

**[05:50]** brunch? And so I recommended a spot. And then she says, "But here's the thing is

**[05:53]** then she says, "But here's the thing is

**[05:53]** then she says, "But here's the thing is we've been there an awful lot lately and

**[05:55]** we've been there an awful lot lately and

**[05:55]** we've been there an awful lot lately and I'm kind of burnt out on it. How about

**[05:56]** I'm kind of burnt out on it. How about

**[05:56]** I'm kind of burnt out on it. How about we go somewhere else?" Okay, fantastic.

**[05:59]** we go somewhere else?" Okay, fantastic.

**[05:59]** we go somewhere else?" Okay, fantastic. And so then I recommend that a different


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** And so then I recommend that a different

**[06:00]** And so then I recommend that a different spot. And then she thinks for a minute

**[06:02]** spot. And then she thinks for a minute

**[06:02]** spot. And then she thinks for a minute and she says, "You know, I'm really kind

**[06:04]** and she says, "You know, I'm really kind

**[06:04]** and she says, "You know, I'm really kind of craving waffles."

**[06:06]** of craving waffles."

**[06:06]** of craving waffles." Who doesn't love waffles? Fantastic. And

**[06:08]** Who doesn't love waffles? Fantastic. And

**[06:08]** Who doesn't love waffles? Fantastic. And so then I recommended another spot and

**[06:09]** so then I recommended another spot and

**[06:09]** so then I recommended another spot and and off we went. Now that back and forth

**[06:11]** and off we went. Now that back and forth

**[06:11]** and off we went. Now that back and forth is like very normal to human

**[06:14]** is like very normal to human

**[06:14]** is like very normal to human conversation that I was given a little

**[06:16]** conversation that I was given a little

**[06:16]** conversation that I was given a little bit of context. Let's go to brunch. And

**[06:18]** bit of context. Let's go to brunch. And

**[06:18]** bit of context. Let's go to brunch. And then I gave based on the context that I

**[06:20]** then I gave based on the context that I

**[06:20]** then I gave based on the context that I had a perfectly valid answer and then a

**[06:23]** had a perfectly valid answer and then a

**[06:23]** had a perfectly valid answer and then a little bit more information was provided

**[06:26]** little bit more information was provided

**[06:26]** little bit more information was provided and I gave another answer and then

**[06:28]** and I gave another answer and then

**[06:28]** and I gave another answer and then eventually we found the solution that we

**[06:30]** eventually we found the solution that we

**[06:30]** eventually we found the solution that we were driving towards and that's exactly

**[06:32]** were driving towards and that's exactly

**[06:32]** were driving towards and that's exactly how we're going to work with copilot is

**[06:35]** how we're going to work with copilot is

**[06:35]** how we're going to work with copilot is that we're going to give copilot

**[06:36]** that we're going to give copilot

**[06:36]** that we're going to give copilot context. We're going to help point it in

**[06:38]** context. We're going to help point it in

**[06:38]** context. We're going to help point it in the right direction and then we're going

**[06:40]** the right direction and then we're going

**[06:40]** the right direction and then we're going to work together to get to the solution

**[06:43]** to work together to get to the solution

**[06:43]** to work together to get to the solution that we are looking for. Now, whenever

**[06:46]** that we are looking for. Now, whenever

**[06:46]** that we are looking for. Now, whenever we're talking about context, there's

**[06:48]** we're talking about context, there's

**[06:48]** we're talking about context, there's oftentimes a lot of focus on the prompt.

**[06:52]** oftentimes a lot of focus on the prompt.

**[06:52]** oftentimes a lot of focus on the prompt. Now, don't get me wrong, the prompt that

**[06:54]** Now, don't get me wrong, the prompt that

**[06:54]** Now, don't get me wrong, the prompt that we use for Copilot when we're using

**[06:56]** we use for Copilot when we're using

**[06:56]** we use for Copilot when we're using chat, when we're creating an issue, all

**[06:58]** chat, when we're creating an issue, all

**[06:58]** chat, when we're creating an issue, all of that is very, very important, but it


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** of that is very, very important, but it

**[07:01]** of that is very, very important, but it really goes beyond just that prompt that

**[07:04]** really goes beyond just that prompt that

**[07:04]** really goes beyond just that prompt that we give to Copilot. And I honestly find

**[07:06]** we give to Copilot. And I honestly find

**[07:06]** we give to Copilot. And I honestly find that a lot of times when people are

**[07:08]** that a lot of times when people are

**[07:08]** that a lot of times when people are first getting started with Copilot that

**[07:11]** first getting started with Copilot that

**[07:11]** first getting started with Copilot that there's a little bit too much focus on

**[07:14]** there's a little bit too much focus on

**[07:14]** there's a little bit too much focus on that prompt itself

**[07:17]** that prompt itself

**[07:17]** that prompt itself because what Copilot's going to use for

**[07:18]** because what Copilot's going to use for

**[07:18]** because what Copilot's going to use for context is everything that it sees. And

**[07:20]** context is everything that it sees. And

**[07:20]** context is everything that it sees. And so that's going to include your code. So

**[07:24]** so that's going to include your code. So

**[07:24]** so that's going to include your code. So making sure that your code is readable

**[07:27]** making sure that your code is readable

**[07:27]** making sure that your code is readable is extremely important that a lot unlike

**[07:29]** is extremely important that a lot unlike

**[07:29]** is extremely important that a lot unlike a lot of other tools that you're going

**[07:30]** a lot of other tools that you're going

**[07:30]** a lot of other tools that you're going to be using. Well, there'll be a script

**[07:32]** to be using. Well, there'll be a script

**[07:32]** to be using. Well, there'll be a script where it's going to build your code or

**[07:34]** where it's going to build your code or

**[07:34]** where it's going to build your code or scan all of your code and look for

**[07:35]** scan all of your code and look for

**[07:35]** scan all of your code and look for different patterns and so forth. With

**[07:38]** different patterns and so forth. With

**[07:38]** different patterns and so forth. With C-Pilot, again, AI pair programmer, it's

**[07:41]** C-Pilot, again, AI pair programmer, it's

**[07:41]** C-Pilot, again, AI pair programmer, it's going to behave an awful lot like a pro

**[07:43]** going to behave an awful lot like a pro

**[07:43]** going to behave an awful lot like a pro another programmer coming along and

**[07:44]** another programmer coming along and

**[07:44]** another programmer coming along and reading your code. And if your code

**[07:46]** reading your code. And if your code

**[07:46]** reading your code. And if your code isn't readable, if you're using a lot of

**[07:48]** isn't readable, if you're using a lot of

**[07:48]** isn't readable, if you're using a lot of abbreviations, you're using um names

**[07:50]** abbreviations, you're using um names

**[07:50]** abbreviations, you're using um names that aren't clear, you're using single

**[07:52]** that aren't clear, you're using single

**[07:52]** that aren't clear, you're using single letter variable names, which are the

**[07:56]** bane of my existence,

**[07:56]** bane of my existence, copilot's not going to be able to easily

**[07:59]** copilot's not going to be able to easily

**[07:59]** copilot's not going to be able to easily understand that.


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** understand that.

**[08:01]** understand that. On top of that, comments. Now,

**[08:04]** On top of that, comments. Now,

**[08:04]** On top of that, comments. Now, I do have a little bit of a belief that

**[08:09]** I do have a little bit of a belief that

**[08:09]** I do have a little bit of a belief that code that's easy to read shouldn't need

**[08:11]** code that's easy to read shouldn't need

**[08:11]** code that's easy to read shouldn't need comments. That the code should describe

**[08:14]** comments. That the code should describe

**[08:14]** comments. That the code should describe well enough what it is that it's doing.

**[08:18]** well enough what it is that it's doing.

**[08:18]** well enough what it is that it's doing. But we all know that that's not always

**[08:19]** But we all know that that's not always

**[08:19]** But we all know that that's not always the case. We all know that we fall short

**[08:21]** the case. We all know that we fall short

**[08:21]** the case. We all know that we fall short of that. And that a couple of lines of

**[08:23]** of that. And that a couple of lines of

**[08:23]** of that. And that a couple of lines of comments left behind is not only going

**[08:26]** comments left behind is not only going

**[08:26]** comments left behind is not only going to help you six months later when you go

**[08:28]** to help you six months later when you go

**[08:28]** to help you six months later when you go back to that codebase and trying to

**[08:29]** back to that codebase and trying to

**[08:29]** back to that codebase and trying to figure out what it is that you were

**[08:30]** figure out what it is that you were

**[08:30]** figure out what it is that you were doing, but it's going to help again that

**[08:33]** doing, but it's going to help again that

**[08:33]** doing, but it's going to help again that pair programmer and that AI pair

**[08:35]** pair programmer and that AI pair

**[08:35]** pair programmer and that AI pair programmer. So having in a few comments

**[08:38]** programmer. So having in a few comments

**[08:38]** programmer. So having in a few comments and then last but not least is having a

**[08:42]** and then last but not least is having a

**[08:42]** and then last but not least is having a good project structure. Allowing C-Pilot

**[08:45]** good project structure. Allowing C-Pilot

**[08:45]** good project structure. Allowing C-Pilot to be able to quickly find the different

**[08:48]** to be able to quickly find the different

**[08:48]** to be able to quickly find the different resources that it's going to need is

**[08:50]** resources that it's going to need is

**[08:50]** resources that it's going to need is also really important. So all of that

**[08:52]** also really important. So all of that

**[08:52]** also really important. So all of that plays into context. And that brings us

**[08:55]** plays into context. And that brings us

**[08:55]** plays into context. And that brings us into this spot right here of helping

**[08:58]** into this spot right here of helping

**[08:58]** into this spot right here of helping co-pilot help you. I sort of like to say


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:01]** co-pilot help you. I sort of like to say

**[09:01]** co-pilot help you. I sort of like to say don't be passive aggressive with

**[09:04]** don't be passive aggressive with

**[09:04]** don't be passive aggressive with co-pilot.

**[09:06]** co-pilot.

**[09:06]** co-pilot. that don't throw something at co-pilot

**[09:08]** that don't throw something at co-pilot

**[09:08]** that don't throw something at co-pilot and kind of like hope that it figures

**[09:09]** and kind of like hope that it figures

**[09:09]** and kind of like hope that it figures out what you really really meant. That

**[09:12]** out what you really really meant. That

**[09:12]** out what you really really meant. That if you know something or if you know

**[09:14]** if you know something or if you know

**[09:14]** if you know something or if you know that there's a particular piece of

**[09:15]** that there's a particular piece of

**[09:15]** that there's a particular piece of information that co-pilot should be

**[09:17]** information that co-pilot should be

**[09:17]** information that co-pilot should be considering,

**[09:19]** considering,

**[09:19]** considering, tell co-pilot that. And what you're

**[09:21]** tell co-pilot that. And what you're

**[09:21]** tell co-pilot that. And what you're going to see is you've got a lot of

**[09:23]** going to see is you've got a lot of

**[09:23]** going to see is you've got a lot of great tools with which to do that. So

**[09:26]** great tools with which to do that. So

**[09:26]** great tools with which to do that. So again, that context, all that background

**[09:27]** again, that context, all that background

**[09:28]** again, that context, all that background information, and we're going to see a

**[09:29]** information, and we're going to see a

**[09:29]** information, and we're going to see a lot of different ways that we can do

**[09:31]** lot of different ways that we can do

**[09:31]** lot of different ways that we can do this through like instruction files or

**[09:32]** this through like instruction files or

**[09:32]** this through like instruction files or again those comments, again, that good

**[09:34]** again those comments, again, that good

**[09:34]** again those comments, again, that good project structure, the intent, be clear

**[09:37]** project structure, the intent, be clear

**[09:38]** project structure, the intent, be clear about what it is that you're trying to

**[09:39]** about what it is that you're trying to

**[09:39]** about what it is that you're trying to do and be clear about it, that clarity

**[09:42]** do and be clear about it, that clarity

**[09:42]** do and be clear about it, that clarity aspect. And when we're talking about

**[09:44]** aspect. And when we're talking about

**[09:44]** aspect. And when we're talking about clarity, for those of us that have maybe

**[09:47]** clarity, for those of us that have maybe

**[09:47]** clarity, for those of us that have maybe worked around with like old chatbots and

**[09:49]** worked around with like old chatbots and

**[09:49]** worked around with like old chatbots and we got very used to just sending very

**[09:50]** we got very used to just sending very

**[09:50]** we got very used to just sending very tur commands because natural language

**[09:53]** tur commands because natural language

**[09:53]** tur commands because natural language processing back a few years ago just was

**[09:55]** processing back a few years ago just was

**[09:55]** processing back a few years ago just was not really all that strong. So we were

**[09:57]** not really all that strong. So we were

**[09:57]** not really all that strong. So we were effectively using it like a command line


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** effectively using it like a command line

**[10:00]** effectively using it like a command line interface.

**[10:02]** interface.

**[10:02]** interface. We want to be a bit more verbose, be a

**[10:04]** We want to be a bit more verbose, be a

**[10:04]** We want to be a bit more verbose, be a bit more flowery, make sure that we're

**[10:05]** bit more flowery, make sure that we're

**[10:05]** bit more flowery, make sure that we're easy to understand. And then last but

**[10:07]** easy to understand. And then last but

**[10:07]** easy to understand. And then last but not least, that specificity. If we want

**[10:09]** not least, that specificity. If we want

**[10:09]** not least, that specificity. If we want something done a particular way, let's

**[10:11]** something done a particular way, let's

**[10:11]** something done a particular way, let's be clear about it. Let's get in and do

**[10:14]** be clear about it. Let's get in and do

**[10:14]** be clear about it. Let's get in and do it.

**[10:16]** it.

**[10:16]** it. So, let's introduce real quickly here

**[10:18]** So, let's introduce real quickly here

**[10:18]** So, let's introduce real quickly here the different workloads that we have

**[10:20]** the different workloads that we have

**[10:20]** the different workloads that we have available to us. Now, the glowing one on

**[10:22]** available to us. Now, the glowing one on

**[10:22]** available to us. Now, the glowing one on the right is not necessarily to indicate

**[10:25]** the right is not necessarily to indicate

**[10:25]** the right is not necessarily to indicate that hey, that is um uh the best, but

**[10:29]** that hey, that is um uh the best, but

**[10:29]** that hey, that is um uh the best, but rather just simply that that's new and

**[10:31]** rather just simply that that's new and

**[10:31]** rather just simply that that's new and new things are shiny.

**[10:34]** new things are shiny.

**[10:34]** new things are shiny. So, over on the far left is code

**[10:36]** So, over on the far left is code

**[10:36]** So, over on the far left is code completion. And this is sort of the

**[10:38]** completion. And this is sort of the

**[10:38]** completion. And this is sort of the original version, if you will, of GitHub

**[10:40]** original version, if you will, of GitHub

**[10:40]** original version, if you will, of GitHub copilot that I'm typing away. I'm coding

**[10:43]** copilot that I'm typing away. I'm coding

**[10:43]** copilot that I'm typing away. I'm coding away. And then C-pilot right in line is

**[10:45]** away. And then C-pilot right in line is

**[10:45]** away. And then C-pilot right in line is going to start making suggestions

**[10:47]** going to start making suggestions

**[10:47]** going to start making suggestions about what my next line, my next block,

**[10:51]** about what my next line, my next block,

**[10:51]** about what my next line, my next block, my next class, my next function is going

**[10:53]** my next class, my next function is going

**[10:53]** my next class, my next function is going to be. And this is wonderful. If you're

**[10:55]** to be. And this is wonderful. If you're

**[10:55]** to be. And this is wonderful. If you're in the zone, you know what you're doing.

**[10:56]** in the zone, you know what you're doing.

**[10:56]** in the zone, you know what you're doing. Just type away and C-pilot can then help

**[10:59]** Just type away and C-pilot can then help

**[10:59]** Just type away and C-pilot can then help you write code. And then we get into


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:01]** you write code. And then we get into

**[11:01]** you write code. And then we get into chat and we get into edit mode. Now chat

**[11:04]** chat and we get into edit mode. Now chat

**[11:04]** chat and we get into edit mode. Now chat originally just had ask which is going

**[11:06]** originally just had ask which is going

**[11:06]** originally just had ask which is going to be for singleshot explain this code

**[11:08]** to be for singleshot explain this code

**[11:08]** to be for singleshot explain this code to me I need you to create a file

**[11:11]** to me I need you to create a file

**[11:11]** to me I need you to create a file whereas with edits mode

**[11:13]** whereas with edits mode

**[11:13]** whereas with edits mode what that's going to allow me to do is

**[11:15]** what that's going to allow me to do is

**[11:15]** what that's going to allow me to do is that's going to allow me to edit

**[11:18]** that's going to allow me to edit

**[11:18]** that's going to allow me to edit multiple files in one shot because when

**[11:21]** multiple files in one shot because when

**[11:21]** multiple files in one shot because when we think about even the most basic of

**[11:24]** we think about even the most basic of

**[11:24]** we think about even the most basic of updates say like I'm just updating a web

**[11:26]** updates say like I'm just updating a web

**[11:26]** updates say like I'm just updating a web page I'm going to update an HTML file a

**[11:29]** page I'm going to update an HTML file a

**[11:29]** page I'm going to update an HTML file a CSS file and a JavaScript file

**[11:32]** CSS file and a JavaScript file

**[11:32]** CSS file and a JavaScript file there's very you have any code updates

**[11:34]** there's very you have any code updates

**[11:34]** there's very you have any code updates that are single file anymore. And so

**[11:37]** that are single file anymore. And so

**[11:37]** that are single file anymore. And so with edits, I can then guide C-pilot

**[11:39]** with edits, I can then guide C-pilot

**[11:39]** with edits, I can then guide C-pilot through editing multiple files.

**[11:42]** through editing multiple files.

**[11:42]** through editing multiple files. And then we get into local agent mode

**[11:45]** And then we get into local agent mode

**[11:45]** And then we get into local agent mode where now copilot's going to kind of

**[11:47]** where now copilot's going to kind of

**[11:47]** where now copilot's going to kind of lead the way. But what we're really

**[11:49]** lead the way. But what we're really

**[11:49]** lead the way. But what we're really going to see with agent mode is that

**[11:51]** going to see with agent mode is that

**[11:51]** going to see with agent mode is that it's going to behave an awful lot like a

**[11:53]** it's going to behave an awful lot like a

**[11:53]** it's going to behave an awful lot like a developer. That it will be able to

**[11:54]** developer. That it will be able to

**[11:54]** developer. That it will be able to explore your project. It'll be able to

**[11:57]** explore your project. It'll be able to

**[11:57]** explore your project. It'll be able to find files and it will be able to run

**[11:59]** find files and it will be able to run


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** find files and it will be able to run external tasks. So, it'll be able to

**[12:01]** external tasks. So, it'll be able to

**[12:02]** external tasks. So, it'll be able to build your code. It'll be able to run

**[12:04]** build your code. It'll be able to run

**[12:04]** build your code. It'll be able to run tests, and if it detects that anything

**[12:06]** tests, and if it detects that anything

**[12:06]** tests, and if it detects that anything has gone wrong, it'll actually be able

**[12:08]** has gone wrong, it'll actually be able

**[12:08]** has gone wrong, it'll actually be able to self-heal. I'm going to come back to

**[12:10]** to self-heal. I'm going to come back to

**[12:10]** to self-heal. I'm going to come back to questions in a little bit.

**[12:12]** questions in a little bit.

**[12:12]** questions in a little bit. Last but not least is Copilot Coding

**[12:14]** Last but not least is Copilot Coding

**[12:14]** Last but not least is Copilot Coding Agent. And with Copilot Coding Agent,

**[12:16]** Agent. And with Copilot Coding Agent,

**[12:16]** Agent. And with Copilot Coding Agent, what I'm going to be able to do is take

**[12:18]** what I'm going to be able to do is take

**[12:18]** what I'm going to be able to do is take an issue in my repository, assign that

**[12:21]** an issue in my repository, assign that

**[12:21]** an issue in my repository, assign that to C-Pilot,

**[12:23]** to C-Pilot,

**[12:23]** to C-Pilot, and then I get to go on about doing

**[12:26]** and then I get to go on about doing

**[12:26]** and then I get to go on about doing something else.

**[12:27]** something else.

**[12:27]** something else. So if I have like little tasks, little

**[12:30]** So if I have like little tasks, little

**[12:30]** So if I have like little tasks, little things that I just haven't been able to

**[12:31]** things that I just haven't been able to

**[12:31]** things that I just haven't been able to get to, I can go ahead and assign that

**[12:33]** get to, I can go ahead and assign that

**[12:33]** get to, I can go ahead and assign that issue, then I can focus my attention on

**[12:36]** issue, then I can focus my attention on

**[12:36]** issue, then I can focus my attention on the bigger problems. And so those are

**[12:38]** the bigger problems. And so those are

**[12:38]** the bigger problems. And so those are the different workloads that are

**[12:40]** the different workloads that are

**[12:40]** the different workloads that are available to us with copilot. And so

**[12:42]** available to us with copilot. And so

**[12:42]** available to us with copilot. And so that is coding agent. We're going to be

**[12:44]** that is coding agent. We're going to be

**[12:44]** that is coding agent. We're going to be able to give it a task and then away we

**[12:46]** able to give it a task and then away we

**[12:46]** able to give it a task and then away we go from there. So without any further

**[12:49]** go from there. So without any further

**[12:49]** go from there. So without any further delay, I'm going to actually um kind of

**[12:52]** delay, I'm going to actually um kind of

**[12:52]** delay, I'm going to actually um kind of leave that there and let's go ahead and

**[12:55]** leave that there and let's go ahead and

**[12:56]** leave that there and let's go ahead and get started. So, first thing before you

**[12:57]** get started. So, first thing before you

**[12:57]** get started. So, first thing before you click on that URL, this is going to be a

**[12:59]** click on that URL, this is going to be a

**[12:59]** click on that URL, this is going to be a real quick um um test. You know how many


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:01]** real quick um um test. You know how many

**[13:01]** real quick um um test. You know how many of you were probably in elementary

**[13:02]** of you were probably in elementary

**[13:02]** of you were probably in elementary school and you got handed that uh sheet

**[13:05]** school and you got handed that uh sheet

**[13:05]** school and you got handed that uh sheet with like 40 steps on it and step one

**[13:08]** with like 40 steps on it and step one

**[13:08]** with like 40 steps on it and step one was read all the instructions to the end

**[13:11]** was read all the instructions to the end

**[13:11]** was read all the instructions to the end and then step two was write your name

**[13:13]** and then step two was write your name

**[13:13]** and then step two was write your name and then step 40 was just do steps one

**[13:15]** and then step 40 was just do steps one

**[13:15]** and then step 40 was just do steps one and two. How many people did all the

**[13:17]** and two. How many people did all the

**[13:17]** and two. How many people did all the steps?

**[13:19]** steps?

**[13:19]** steps? Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. Um so, in any

**[13:23]** Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. Um so, in any

**[22:52]** else is doing. So, um I honestly am not

**[22:52]** else is doing. So, um I honestly am not familiar at all with any of the feature

**[22:54]** familiar at all with any of the feature

**[22:54]** familiar at all with any of the feature sets of any of the alternatives that

**[22:56]** sets of any of the alternatives that

**[22:56]** sets of any of the alternatives that that are out there. Um

**[22:59]** that are out there. Um

**[22:59]** that are out there. Um and honestly, like going out like


### [23:00 - 24:00]

**[23:02]** and honestly, like going out like

**[23:02]** and honestly, like going out like bashing competition and things like that

**[23:03]** bashing competition and things like that

**[23:04]** bashing competition and things like that is not necessarily my vibe. Don't worry

**[23:05]** is not necessarily my vibe. Don't worry

**[23:05]** is not necessarily my vibe. Don't worry about it. Um um so what I would say is

**[23:10]** about it. Um um so what I would say is

**[23:10]** about it. Um um so what I would say is if you're going hey um Windinsurf does

**[23:12]** if you're going hey um Windinsurf does

**[23:12]** if you're going hey um Windinsurf does this, can copilot do it? Um does cursor

**[23:15]** this, can copilot do it? Um does cursor

**[23:15]** this, can copilot do it? Um does cursor do this or cursor does this? Can copilot

**[23:17]** do this or cursor does this? Can copilot

**[23:17]** do this or cursor does this? Can copilot do that? I can answer those types of

**[23:18]** do that? I can answer those types of

**[23:18]** do that? I can answer those types of questions, but if you're like looking

**[23:19]** questions, but if you're like looking

**[23:19]** questions, but if you're like looking for like a feature comparison or things

**[23:21]** for like a feature comparison or things

**[23:21]** for like a feature comparison or things like that, I I'm really not able to do

**[23:23]** like that, I I'm really not able to do

**[23:23]** like that, I I'm really not able to do that because again, I just don't know

**[23:24]** that because again, I just don't know

**[23:24]** that because again, I just don't know those well enough. There was a hand over

**[23:26]** those well enough. There was a hand over

**[23:26]** those well enough. There was a hand over here. Um, as you're showing that

**[23:29]** here. Um, as you're showing that

**[23:29]** here. Um, as you're showing that co-pilot can be more aware of the

**[23:30]** co-pilot can be more aware of the

**[23:30]** co-pilot can be more aware of the environment. Yeah.

**[23:38]** SQL data source.

**[23:38]** SQL data source. Yeah. So, this is a fantastic question.

**[23:40]** Yeah. So, this is a fantastic question.

**[23:40]** Yeah. So, this is a fantastic question. So the question is um can co-pilot be

**[23:43]** So the question is um can co-pilot be

**[23:43]** So the question is um can co-pilot be aware of um external uh data sources? Um

**[23:48]** aware of um external uh data sources? Um

**[23:48]** aware of um external uh data sources? Um and the answer is not directly but with

**[23:50]** and the answer is not directly but with

**[23:50]** and the answer is not directly but with a little thing called MCP or model

**[23:52]** a little thing called MCP or model

**[23:52]** a little thing called MCP or model context protocol it can. So if you're

**[23:54]** context protocol it can. So if you're

**[23:54]** context protocol it can. So if you're not already familiar with model context

**[23:56]** not already familiar with model context

**[23:56]** not already familiar with model context protocol he says bringing up this slide

**[23:58]** protocol he says bringing up this slide

**[23:58]** protocol he says bringing up this slide right here um the whole goal is to be


### [24:00 - 25:00]

**[24:01]** right here um the whole goal is to be

**[24:01]** right here um the whole goal is to be able to expand um copilot's

**[24:03]** able to expand um copilot's

**[24:03]** able to expand um copilot's capabilities. So, Copilot is built on

**[24:05]** capabilities. So, Copilot is built on

**[24:05]** capabilities. So, Copilot is built on top of an LLM, large language model. Um,

**[24:07]** top of an LLM, large language model. Um,

**[24:08]** top of an LLM, large language model. Um, and that LLM is always going to be

**[24:10]** and that LLM is always going to be

**[24:10]** and that LLM is always going to be static. Um, and so what MCP allows you

**[24:13]** static. Um, and so what MCP allows you

**[24:13]** static. Um, and so what MCP allows you to do is it allows you to give Copilot

**[24:17]** to do is it allows you to give Copilot

**[24:17]** to do is it allows you to give Copilot the ability to call out to external

**[24:19]** the ability to call out to external

**[24:19]** the ability to call out to external services. And, um, the diagram looks a

**[24:22]** services. And, um, the diagram looks a

**[24:22]** services. And, um, the diagram looks a little bit like this. Um, I need

**[24:24]** little bit like this. Um, I need

**[24:24]** little bit like this. Um, I need everybody to memorize this. There's

**[24:25]** everybody to memorize this. There's

**[24:26]** everybody to memorize this. There's going to be a quiz on this in about 15

**[24:28]** going to be a quiz on this in about 15

**[24:28]** going to be a quiz on this in about 15 minutes. Um, and basically what you're

**[24:31]** minutes. Um, and basically what you're

**[24:31]** minutes. Um, and basically what you're going to notice if you look at this is

**[24:33]** going to notice if you look at this is

**[24:33]** going to notice if you look at this is that your request is going to go to

**[24:35]** that your request is going to go to

**[24:35]** that your request is going to go to copilot. Then it's going to call out to

**[24:38]** copilot. Then it's going to call out to

**[24:38]** copilot. Then it's going to call out to the MCP server which is then able to

**[24:41]** the MCP server which is then able to

**[24:41]** the MCP server which is then able to access external resources. So one of the

**[24:44]** access external resources. So one of the

**[24:44]** access external resources. So one of the MCP servers that's available for example

**[24:46]** MCP servers that's available for example

**[24:46]** MCP servers that's available for example is GitHub. And so what I can actually do

**[24:49]** is GitHub. And so what I can actually do

**[24:49]** is GitHub. And so what I can actually do then with that MCP server is I can then

**[24:51]** then with that MCP server is I can then

**[24:51]** then with that MCP server is I can then go to C-pilot and I can say hey create

**[24:53]** go to C-pilot and I can say hey create

**[24:53]** go to C-pilot and I can say hey create an issue on this. So that way maybe I'm

**[24:56]** an issue on this. So that way maybe I'm

**[24:56]** an issue on this. So that way maybe I'm I'm in the zone, I'm coding, coding,

**[24:57]** I'm in the zone, I'm coding, coding,

**[24:58]** I'm in the zone, I'm coding, coding, coding, and I realize, hey, there's

**[24:59]** coding, and I realize, hey, there's

**[24:59]** coding, and I realize, hey, there's something I want to be able to look at


### [25:00 - 26:00]

**[25:00]** something I want to be able to look at

**[25:00]** something I want to be able to look at later. Let me just go ahead and create a

**[25:01]** later. Let me just go ahead and create a

**[25:01]** later. Let me just go ahead and create a real quick issue on that. Then I can do

**[25:03]** real quick issue on that. Then I can do

**[25:03]** real quick issue on that. Then I can do that right from uh from chat. Or maybe I

**[25:05]** that right from uh from chat. Or maybe I

**[25:05]** that right from uh from chat. Or maybe I want to go in and do a search. I can

**[25:06]** want to go in and do a search. I can

**[25:06]** want to go in and do a search. I can again do that right from chat. Or again,

**[25:08]** again do that right from chat. Or again,

**[25:08]** again do that right from chat. Or again, I've got databases and I want to be able

**[25:10]** I've got databases and I want to be able

**[25:10]** I've got databases and I want to be able to like get that schema or I want to be

**[25:12]** to like get that schema or I want to be

**[25:12]** to like get that schema or I want to be able to get that data from there. Then I

**[25:13]** able to get that data from there. Then I

**[25:14]** able to get that data from there. Then I can do that with uh with my MCP server.

**[25:16]** can do that with uh with my MCP server.

**[25:16]** can do that with uh with my MCP server. Now, a couple of real quick things on

**[25:18]** Now, a couple of real quick things on

**[25:18]** Now, a couple of real quick things on MCP servers. Number one is that there

**[25:20]** MCP servers. Number one is that there

**[25:20]** MCP servers. Number one is that there are a bunch of um first-party ones that

**[25:24]** are a bunch of um first-party ones that

**[25:24]** are a bunch of um first-party ones that are created um like we have one, Azure

**[25:26]** are created um like we have one, Azure

**[25:26]** are created um like we have one, Azure has one, Playright has one um and then

**[25:30]** has one, Playright has one um and then

**[25:30]** has one, Playright has one um and then there's a lot of community ones uh that

**[25:33]** there's a lot of community ones uh that

**[25:33]** there's a lot of community ones uh that are out there. Now, here's the catch is

**[25:36]** are out there. Now, here's the catch is

**[25:36]** are out there. Now, here's the catch is that MCP servers are not only able to

**[25:38]** that MCP servers are not only able to

**[25:38]** that MCP servers are not only able to access data on your behalf, but they're

**[25:41]** access data on your behalf, but they're

**[25:41]** access data on your behalf, but they're also able to perform tasks on your

**[25:43]** also able to perform tasks on your

**[25:43]** also able to perform tasks on your behalf.

**[25:45]** behalf.

**[25:45]** behalf. So, as a result, before you utilize a

**[25:49]** So, as a result, before you utilize a

**[25:49]** So, as a result, before you utilize a third-party MCP server, make sure it is

**[25:53]** third-party MCP server, make sure it is

**[25:53]** third-party MCP server, make sure it is something that you trust

**[25:58]** something that you trust

**[25:58]** something that you trust or you can consider creating one on your


### [26:00 - 27:00]

**[26:00]** or you can consider creating one on your

**[26:00]** or you can consider creating one on your own. I'm going to admit I haven't yet

**[26:02]** own. I'm going to admit I haven't yet

**[26:02]** own. I'm going to admit I haven't yet created one on my own, but um

**[26:07]** created one on my own, but um

**[26:07]** created one on my own, but um um but um it is something that is um um

**[26:13]** um but um it is something that is um um

**[26:13]** um but um it is something that is um um sorry I got

**[26:15]** sorry I got

**[26:15]** sorry I got thrown um oh I haven't created one on my

**[26:18]** thrown um oh I haven't created one on my

**[26:18]** thrown um oh I haven't created one on my own. Um, but I've seen a lot of people

**[26:20]** own. Um, but I've seen a lot of people

**[26:20]** own. Um, but I've seen a lot of people create them and it does seem to be

**[26:22]** create them and it does seem to be

**[26:22]** create them and it does seem to be something that's relatively

**[26:23]** something that's relatively

**[26:23]** something that's relatively straightforward um, as far as setting it

**[26:24]** straightforward um, as far as setting it

**[26:24]** straightforward um, as far as setting it up that you can just capture the

**[26:26]** up that you can just capture the

**[26:26]** up that you can just capture the request, process it, and then send it

**[26:27]** request, process it, and then send it

**[26:27]** request, process it, and then send it off from there and you basically just

**[26:29]** off from there and you basically just

**[26:29]** off from there and you basically just create a set of endpoints for copilot to

**[26:31]** create a set of endpoints for copilot to

**[26:31]** create a set of endpoints for copilot to to figure out. Okay, really quickly on

**[26:33]** to figure out. Okay, really quickly on

**[26:33]** to figure out. Okay, really quickly on that, if you have a backup for your

**[26:35]** that, if you have a backup for your

**[26:35]** that, if you have a backup for your database that's in like a SQL file, can

**[26:37]** database that's in like a SQL file, can

**[26:37]** database that's in like a SQL file, can it consume that as well? Sure.

**[26:39]** it consume that as well? Sure.

**[26:39]** it consume that as well? Sure. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And

**[26:41]** Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And

**[26:41]** Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And in fact, you wouldn't even necessarily

**[26:42]** in fact, you wouldn't even necessarily

**[26:42]** in fact, you wouldn't even necessarily like if what you're looking for is to

**[26:45]** like if what you're looking for is to

**[26:45]** like if what you're looking for is to help co-pilot write database queries

**[26:48]** help co-pilot write database queries

**[26:48]** help co-pilot write database queries really well, um all that copilot really

**[26:50]** really well, um all that copilot really

**[26:50]** really well, um all that copilot really needs at that point is your DDL is your

**[26:52]** needs at that point is your DDL is your

**[26:52]** needs at that point is your DDL is your data definition language. And that's

**[26:54]** data definition language. And that's

**[26:54]** data definition language. And that's actually something that you can do um

**[26:59]** actually something that you can do um

**[26:59]** actually something that you can do um internally inside of um


### [27:00 - 28:00]

**[27:04]** internally inside of um

**[27:04]** internally inside of um where do I want to go?

**[27:10]** I'm trying to remember this off the top

**[27:10]** I'm trying to remember this off the top of my head. So, I'm probably going to

**[27:12]** of my head. So, I'm probably going to

**[27:12]** of my head. So, I'm probably going to get the exact

**[27:18]** Oh, the Wi-Fi is going to be wonderful

**[27:18]** Oh, the Wi-Fi is going to be wonderful here.

**[27:55]** Why

**[27:55]** Why I am connected to the speaker Wi-Fi?

**[27:57]** I am connected to the speaker Wi-Fi?

**[27:57]** I am connected to the speaker Wi-Fi? Yeah. Okay, that's supposed to be

**[27:59]** Yeah. Okay, that's supposed to be

**[27:59]** Yeah. Okay, that's supposed to be faster.


### [28:00 - 29:00]

**[28:01]** faster.

**[28:01]** faster. There we go. Um,

**[28:23]** I think this is it. Um, yeah, it's

**[28:23]** I think this is it. Um, yeah, it's something. There it is. Yeah. Um,

**[28:27]** something. There it is. Yeah. Um,

**[28:27]** something. There it is. Yeah. Um, yeah. So what you could do um if all you

**[28:29]** yeah. So what you could do um if all you

**[28:29]** yeah. So what you could do um if all you have is just the DDL is you could

**[28:31]** have is just the DDL is you could

**[28:31]** have is just the DDL is you could actually just include that with your

**[28:32]** actually just include that with your

**[28:32]** actually just include that with your instructions um and then that way

**[28:34]** instructions um and then that way

**[28:34]** instructions um and then that way anytime that I talk to chat then copilot

**[28:36]** anytime that I talk to chat then copilot

**[28:36]** anytime that I talk to chat then copilot can go ahead and use that and be able to

**[28:38]** can go ahead and use that and be able to

**[28:38]** can go ahead and use that and be able to generate it that way and that's honestly

**[28:39]** generate it that way and that's honestly

**[28:39]** generate it that way and that's honestly simplest thing that works.

**[28:42]** simplest thing that works.

**[28:42]** simplest thing that works. So yeah. Okay. Um yeah.

**[28:55]** Uh absolutely.

**[28:55]** Uh absolutely. So let's talk a little bit. Let's

**[28:57]** So let's talk a little bit. Let's

**[28:57]** So let's talk a little bit. Let's actually do this. I'm going to


### [29:00 - 30:00]

**[29:01]** actually do this. I'm going to

**[29:01]** actually do this. I'm going to um

**[29:03]** um

**[29:03]** um Yeah.

**[29:05]** Yeah.

**[29:05]** Yeah. Yes.

**[29:11]** Yeah. Unfortunately, um, between Wi-Fi

**[29:11]** Yeah. Unfortunately, um, between Wi-Fi issues, access issues, and things like

**[29:13]** issues, access issues, and things like

**[29:13]** issues, access issues, and things like that, we're just not able to to do that.

**[29:16]** that, we're just not able to to do that.

**[29:16]** that, we're just not able to to do that. So, yeah, I'm turning this into sort of

**[29:18]** So, yeah, I'm turning this into sort of

**[29:18]** So, yeah, I'm turning this into sort of like live Q&A and live demos, trying to

**[29:21]** like live Q&A and live demos, trying to

**[29:21]** like live Q&A and live demos, trying to give everybody the best possible value

**[29:22]** give everybody the best possible value

**[29:22]** give everybody the best possible value that I can given the situation that we

**[29:25]** that I can given the situation that we

**[29:25]** that I can given the situation that we have. So, yeah,

**[29:27]** have. So, yeah,

**[29:27]** have. So, yeah, let me do this. Make yourself

**[29:32]** let me do this. Make yourself

**[29:32]** let me do this. Make yourself comfortable, John.


### [30:00 - 31:00]

**[30:19]** Okay. So, let's talk a little bit about

**[30:19]** Okay. So, let's talk a little bit about um copilot coding agent here. So, what

**[30:22]** um copilot coding agent here. So, what

**[30:22]** um copilot coding agent here. So, what I've got here is I have um an issue that

**[30:26]** I've got here is I have um an issue that

**[30:26]** I've got here is I have um an issue that I've created uh and this is just copied

**[30:29]** I've created uh and this is just copied

**[30:29]** I've created uh and this is just copied and pasted tree from the lab um to have

**[30:31]** and pasted tree from the lab um to have

**[30:31]** and pasted tree from the lab um to have it create endpoints for creating and

**[30:33]** it create endpoints for creating and

**[30:33]** it create endpoints for creating and editing games. And the first thing that

**[30:35]** editing games. And the first thing that

**[30:35]** editing games. And the first thing that I want you to notice about the issue

**[30:36]** I want you to notice about the issue

**[30:36]** I want you to notice about the issue here is again the context. That context

**[30:39]** here is again the context. That context

**[30:39]** here is again the context. That context is key here. That the whole goal of

**[30:44]** is key here. That the whole goal of

**[30:44]** is key here. That the whole goal of coding agent is to act asynchronously

**[30:47]** coding agent is to act asynchronously

**[30:47]** coding agent is to act asynchronously that I assign an issue to it and I just

**[30:50]** that I assign an issue to it and I just

**[30:50]** that I assign an issue to it and I just let it do its thing and off co-pilot

**[30:53]** let it do its thing and off co-pilot

**[30:53]** let it do its thing and off co-pilot does and it does its thing and then it

**[30:55]** does and it does its thing and then it

**[30:55]** does and it does its thing and then it will eventually come back to me. And

**[30:56]** will eventually come back to me. And

**[30:56]** will eventually come back to me. And that becomes really really tricky

**[30:58]** that becomes really really tricky

**[30:58]** that becomes really really tricky because how do I then know whether or


### [31:00 - 32:00]

**[31:02]** because how do I then know whether or

**[31:02]** because how do I then know whether or not Copilot has everything that it needs

**[31:08]** not Copilot has everything that it needs

**[31:08]** not Copilot has everything that it needs to be able to perform its work?

**[31:13]** to be able to perform its work?

**[31:13]** to be able to perform its work? I don't know. And so that's the first

**[31:16]** I don't know. And so that's the first

**[31:16]** I don't know. And so that's the first big key. I always love the little eyes.

**[31:18]** big key. I always love the little eyes.

**[31:18]** big key. I always love the little eyes. That's the little indication that

**[31:19]** That's the little indication that

**[31:19]** That's the little indication that co-pilot's now on the test. It's kind of

**[31:21]** co-pilot's now on the test. It's kind of

**[31:21]** co-pilot's now on the test. It's kind of cute. Um,

**[31:23]** cute. Um,

**[31:23]** cute. Um, so the first thing I want to highlight

**[31:25]** so the first thing I want to highlight

**[31:25]** so the first thing I want to highlight is the issue. And you'll notice again

**[31:27]** is the issue. And you'll notice again

**[31:27]** is the issue. And you'll notice again I'm not being passive aggressive with

**[31:28]** I'm not being passive aggressive with

**[31:28]** I'm not being passive aggressive with co-pilot. That if I know what I want it

**[31:30]** co-pilot. That if I know what I want it

**[31:30]** co-pilot. That if I know what I want it to do, if I even know how I want it to

**[31:32]** to do, if I even know how I want it to

**[31:32]** to do, if I even know how I want it to approach the task, I'm going to tell

**[31:34]** approach the task, I'm going to tell

**[31:34]** approach the task, I'm going to tell co-pilot that that

**[31:37]** co-pilot that that

**[31:37]** co-pilot that that you leave for ambiguity sake, the more

**[31:39]** you leave for ambiguity sake, the more

**[31:39]** you leave for ambiguity sake, the more that you leave for the other party to

**[31:41]** that you leave for the other party to

**[31:41]** that you leave for the other party to figure out this is human or this is AI,

**[31:45]** figure out this is human or this is AI,

**[31:45]** figure out this is human or this is AI, the more chance that you're going to

**[31:46]** the more chance that you're going to

**[31:46]** the more chance that you're going to come back to something that you really

**[31:48]** come back to something that you really

**[31:48]** come back to something that you really didn't exactly want.

**[31:50]** didn't exactly want.

**[31:50]** didn't exactly want. So if you want the wall painted a

**[31:52]** So if you want the wall painted a

**[31:52]** So if you want the wall painted a particular shade of red, then say that

**[31:54]** particular shade of red, then say that

**[31:54]** particular shade of red, then say that you want the wall painted a particular

**[31:55]** you want the wall painted a particular

**[31:56]** you want the wall painted a particular shade of red. And so that's exactly what

**[31:58]** shade of red. And so that's exactly what

**[31:58]** shade of red. And so that's exactly what I've done here. But again, as I


### [32:00 - 33:00]

**[32:00]** I've done here. But again, as I

**[32:00]** I've done here. But again, as I highlighted, it goes beyond just the

**[32:01]** highlighted, it goes beyond just the

**[32:02]** highlighted, it goes beyond just the prompt. And effectively, that's what

**[32:03]** prompt. And effectively, that's what

**[32:03]** prompt. And effectively, that's what this is, is this is a prompt. And so

**[32:06]** this is, is this is a prompt. And so

**[32:06]** this is, is this is a prompt. And so Copilot supports some different

**[32:09]** Copilot supports some different

**[32:09]** Copilot supports some different instructions files. Now, right now, it

**[32:11]** instructions files. Now, right now, it

**[32:11]** instructions files. Now, right now, it does depend a little bit on where you

**[32:14]** does depend a little bit on where you

**[32:14]** does depend a little bit on where you are and what you're doing, but with chat

**[32:17]** are and what you're doing, but with chat

**[32:17]** are and what you're doing, but with chat and with coding agent, all of them

**[32:20]** and with coding agent, all of them

**[32:20]** and with coding agent, all of them support

**[32:23]** support

**[32:23]** support copilot-instructions.mmd.

**[32:25]** copilot-instructions.mmd.

**[32:25]** copilot-instructions.mmd. So, if you're using chat and if you're

**[32:28]** So, if you're using chat and if you're

**[32:28]** So, if you're using chat and if you're using coding agent, this supports

**[32:31]** using coding agent, this supports

**[32:31]** using coding agent, this supports copilot instructions,

**[32:32]** copilot instructions,

**[32:32]** copilot instructions, copilot-instructions.mmd.

**[32:35]** copilot-instructions.mmd.

**[32:35]** copilot-instructions.mmd. And if we take a look at this file, what

**[32:36]** And if we take a look at this file, what

**[32:36]** And if we take a look at this file, what I want you to notice, it's just a

**[32:37]** I want you to notice, it's just a

**[32:37]** I want you to notice, it's just a markdown file. So nothing special,

**[32:39]** markdown file. So nothing special,

**[32:39]** markdown file. So nothing special, nothing fancy. And what I've done inside

**[32:42]** nothing fancy. And what I've done inside

**[32:42]** nothing fancy. And what I've done inside of this file is I've given it highlevel

**[32:45]** of this file is I've given it highlevel

**[32:45]** of this file is I've given it highlevel overviews of what we're building, how

**[32:48]** overviews of what we're building, how

**[32:48]** overviews of what we're building, how we're building it, and my project

**[32:49]** we're building it, and my project

**[32:50]** we're building it, and my project structure. So you'll notice, for

**[32:51]** structure. So you'll notice, for

**[32:52]** structure. So you'll notice, for example, that I've got some guidelines

**[32:55]** example, that I've got some guidelines

**[32:55]** example, that I've got some guidelines right up top. So this is a crowdfunding

**[32:56]** right up top. So this is a crowdfunding

**[32:56]** right up top. So this is a crowdfunding platform uh with a developer theme, the

**[32:59]** platform uh with a developer theme, the

**[32:59]** platform uh with a developer theme, the application uses yada yada yada. You'll


### [33:00 - 34:00]

**[33:01]** application uses yada yada yada. You'll

**[33:02]** application uses yada yada yada. You'll also notice I've given it coding

**[33:03]** also notice I've given it coding

**[33:03]** also notice I've given it coding standards. This is what's required

**[33:05]** standards. This is what's required

**[33:05]** standards. This is what's required before each commit. I've given it

**[33:07]** before each commit. I've given it

**[33:07]** before each commit. I've given it language guidance and I've also told it

**[33:10]** language guidance and I've also told it

**[33:10]** language guidance and I've also told it how it is that I want my Python and

**[33:12]** how it is that I want my Python and

**[33:12]** how it is that I want my Python and Flask to be created, how I want my spelt

**[33:14]** Flask to be created, how I want my spelt

**[33:14]** Flask to be created, how I want my spelt and Astra to be created, how I want my

**[33:16]** and Astra to be created, how I want my

**[33:16]** and Astra to be created, how I want my style, my my actions. I've given it

**[33:19]** style, my my actions. I've given it

**[33:19]** style, my my actions. I've given it information about the scripts that are

**[33:20]** information about the scripts that are

**[33:20]** information about the scripts that are available and I've also documented my

**[33:23]** available and I've also documented my

**[33:23]** available and I've also documented my repository structure.

**[33:27]** repository structure.

**[33:27]** repository structure. Chances are you already have this inside

**[33:29]** Chances are you already have this inside

**[33:30]** Chances are you already have this inside of your projects or at least one would

**[33:32]** of your projects or at least one would

**[33:32]** of your projects or at least one would hope that you do.

**[33:35]** hope that you do.

**[33:35]** hope that you do. And if you don't, here's a good

**[33:36]** And if you don't, here's a good

**[33:36]** And if you don't, here's a good opportunity to create it.

**[33:39]** opportunity to create it.

**[33:39]** opportunity to create it. Hand that to copilot.

**[33:41]** Hand that to copilot.

**[33:41]** Hand that to copilot. And so now, anytime I make a chat

**[33:43]** And so now, anytime I make a chat

**[33:43]** And so now, anytime I make a chat request locally or when coding agent

**[33:45]** request locally or when coding agent

**[33:45]** request locally or when coding agent does its thing, it's going to be

**[33:47]** does its thing, it's going to be

**[33:47]** does its thing, it's going to be considering that.

**[33:49]** considering that.

**[33:49]** considering that. Now, going one step further with coding

**[33:51]** Now, going one step further with coding

**[33:51]** Now, going one step further with coding agent, another big question becomes,

**[33:53]** agent, another big question becomes,

**[33:53]** agent, another big question becomes, okay, well, where's it going to do its

**[33:54]** okay, well, where's it going to do its

**[33:54]** okay, well, where's it going to do its work? So, as it turns out, coding agent

**[33:57]** work? So, as it turns out, coding agent

**[33:57]** work? So, as it turns out, coding agent behind the scenes is using GitHub

**[33:58]** behind the scenes is using GitHub

**[33:58]** behind the scenes is using GitHub actions.


### [34:00 - 35:00]

**[34:00]** actions.

**[34:00]** actions. And you'll notice right here I've got a

**[34:02]** And you'll notice right here I've got a

**[34:02]** And you'll notice right here I've got a special action that's created that's

**[34:04]** special action that's created that's

**[34:04]** special action that's created that's called copilot setup steps.

**[34:07]** called copilot setup steps.

**[34:07]** called copilot setup steps. And so in here I'm now having it install

**[34:10]** And so in here I'm now having it install

**[34:10]** And so in here I'm now having it install everything that I think it's going to

**[34:12]** everything that I think it's going to

**[34:12]** everything that I think it's going to need to do its work. So if there are any

**[34:15]** need to do its work. So if there are any

**[34:15]** need to do its work. So if there are any libraries, any frameworks, any services,

**[34:17]** libraries, any frameworks, any services,

**[34:17]** libraries, any frameworks, any services, anything like that that you need to have

**[34:18]** anything like that that you need to have

**[34:18]** anything like that that you need to have installed, any scripts that you need

**[34:19]** installed, any scripts that you need

**[34:20]** installed, any scripts that you need run, you can set that up right here. So

**[34:23]** run, you can set that up right here. So

**[34:23]** run, you can set that up right here. So now C-pilot is going to have this as its

**[34:25]** now C-pilot is going to have this as its

**[34:26]** now C-pilot is going to have this as its environment to get in and do its work.

**[34:28]** environment to get in and do its work.

**[34:28]** environment to get in and do its work. And it's also going to have this

**[34:30]** And it's also going to have this

**[34:30]** And it's also going to have this instructions file that we highlighted a

**[34:33]** instructions file that we highlighted a

**[34:33]** instructions file that we highlighted a minute ago to be able to act upon as

**[34:36]** minute ago to be able to act upon as

**[34:36]** minute ago to be able to act upon as well.

**[34:38]** well.

**[34:38]** well. Now on top of that,

**[34:41]** Now on top of that,

**[34:41]** Now on top of that, let me go over here to my pull requests

**[34:43]** let me go over here to my pull requests

**[34:43]** let me go over here to my pull requests is I can see the pull request that

**[34:44]** is I can see the pull request that

**[34:44]** is I can see the pull request that Copilot made.

**[34:47]** Copilot made.

**[34:47]** Copilot made. So just made this, you know, was three

**[34:48]** So just made this, you know, was three

**[34:48]** So just made this, you know, was three minutes ago. So this is not a pre-baked

**[34:50]** minutes ago. So this is not a pre-baked

**[34:50]** minutes ago. So this is not a pre-baked cake. We're doing this live.

**[34:56]** And if I open this up and I scroll on

**[34:56]** And if I open this up and I scroll on down,

**[34:58]** down,

**[34:58]** down, I can view the session here and this


### [35:00 - 36:00]

**[35:01]** I can view the session here and this

**[35:01]** I can view the session here and this will show me copilot doing its thing

**[35:04]** will show me copilot doing its thing

**[35:04]** will show me copilot doing its thing behind the scenes and eventually here.

**[35:06]** behind the scenes and eventually here.

**[35:06]** behind the scenes and eventually here. There we go. Moving your mouse makes it

**[35:08]** There we go. Moving your mouse makes it

**[35:08]** There we go. Moving your mouse makes it go faster. What I can see is it's

**[35:10]** go faster. What I can see is it's

**[35:10]** go faster. What I can see is it's actually going out and it's exploring

**[35:12]** actually going out and it's exploring

**[35:12]** actually going out and it's exploring the project and it's digging up

**[35:15]** the project and it's digging up

**[35:15]** the project and it's digging up information on its own as well. So

**[35:18]** information on its own as well. So

**[35:18]** information on its own as well. So again, as we were talking, good code,

**[35:20]** again, as we were talking, good code,

**[35:20]** again, as we were talking, good code, clear code, good comments, good project

**[35:22]** clear code, good comments, good project

**[35:22]** clear code, good comments, good project structure, all of that helps your

**[35:24]** structure, all of that helps your

**[35:24]** structure, all of that helps your developers and all of that is going to

**[35:27]** developers and all of that is going to

**[35:27]** developers and all of that is going to help co-pilot out as well. So I can give

**[35:30]** help co-pilot out as well. So I can give

**[35:30]** help co-pilot out as well. So I can give it information through the issue. I can

**[35:32]** it information through the issue. I can

**[35:32]** it information through the issue. I can give it information through my

**[35:34]** give it information through my

**[35:34]** give it information through my instructions. I give it information kind

**[35:36]** instructions. I give it information kind

**[35:36]** instructions. I give it information kind of implicitly through the project

**[35:38]** of implicitly through the project

**[35:38]** of implicitly through the project itself. And then I can also create that

**[35:41]** itself. And then I can also create that

**[35:41]** itself. And then I can also create that environment by setting up that co-pilot

**[35:43]** environment by setting up that co-pilot

**[35:43]** environment by setting up that co-pilot steps. There was a hand here first.

**[35:45]** steps. There was a hand here first.

**[35:45]** steps. There was a hand here first. Yeah. Yeah. For

**[35:47]** Yeah. Yeah. For

**[35:47]** Yeah. Yeah. For instructions are available.

**[35:55]** Yeah. So, that's a great question. So,

**[35:55]** Yeah. So, that's a great question. So, and I'm gonna answer the second part to

**[35:57]** and I'm gonna answer the second part to

**[35:57]** and I'm gonna answer the second part to that uh of that workspace as well. So,


### [36:00 - 37:00]

**[36:00]** that uh of that workspace as well. So,

**[36:00]** that uh of that workspace as well. So, um when it comes to copilot

**[36:02]** um when it comes to copilot

**[36:02]** um when it comes to copilot instructions, those are always going to

**[36:04]** instructions, those are always going to

**[36:04]** instructions, those are always going to be available. Let me get rid of my red

**[36:06]** be available. Let me get rid of my red

**[36:06]** be available. Let me get rid of my red squiggies here. Um those are always

**[36:09]** squiggies here. Um those are always

**[36:09]** squiggies here. Um those are always going to be available um inside of uh

**[36:12]** going to be available um inside of uh

**[36:12]** going to be available um inside of uh inside of chat here. So, let's say I do

**[36:14]** inside of chat here. So, let's say I do

**[36:14]** inside of chat here. So, let's say I do this. So, I'm going to put this into um

**[36:15]** this. So, I'm going to put this into um

**[36:15]** this. So, I'm going to put this into um agent mode. Um I'm going to leave it as

**[36:18]** agent mode. Um I'm going to leave it as

**[36:18]** agent mode. Um I'm going to leave it as cloud 37. And uh by the way, um I do not

**[36:23]** cloud 37. And uh by the way, um I do not

**[36:23]** cloud 37. And uh by the way, um I do not have a stance on which model is better

**[36:25]** have a stance on which model is better

**[36:26]** have a stance on which model is better than any other model. Um you will

**[36:28]** than any other model. Um you will

**[36:28]** than any other model. Um you will notice, and you kind of pick this up in

**[36:29]** notice, and you kind of pick this up in

**[37:34]** other thing that I want to highlight is

**[37:34]** other thing that I want to highlight is and this right now is particular to

**[37:36]** and this right now is particular to

**[37:36]** and this right now is particular to local chat is I can even create

**[37:41]** local chat is I can even create

**[37:41]** local chat is I can even create um instructions files and this is

**[37:43]** um instructions files and this is

**[37:43]** um instructions files and this is admittedly a little bit

**[37:46]** admittedly a little bit

**[37:46]** admittedly a little bit um

**[37:49]** um

**[37:49]** um it's a little bit tricky to I think

**[37:51]** it's a little bit tricky to I think

**[37:51]** it's a little bit tricky to I think understand kind of the first time that

**[37:52]** understand kind of the first time that

**[37:52]** understand kind of the first time that you see it. Um so kind of go with me on

**[37:54]** you see it. Um so kind of go with me on

**[37:54]** you see it. Um so kind of go with me on this one. So copilot-in instructions

**[37:57]** this one. So copilot-in instructions

**[37:57]** this one. So copilot-in instructions universal every single chat request this

**[37:59]** universal every single chat request this

**[37:59]** universal every single chat request this is going to go


### [38:00 - 39:00]

**[38:01]** is going to go

**[38:01]** is going to go the instructions files these become

**[38:04]** the instructions files these become

**[38:04]** the instructions files these become manual so I can add these in manually to

**[38:08]** manual so I can add these in manually to

**[38:08]** manual so I can add these in manually to a task that I'm performing inside of

**[38:11]** a task that I'm performing inside of

**[38:11]** a task that I'm performing inside of chat he says delaying long enough for it

**[38:13]** chat he says delaying long enough for it

**[38:13]** chat he says delaying long enough for it to finally open. Um so what you're going

**[38:16]** to finally open. Um so what you're going

**[38:16]** to finally open. Um so what you're going to notice again a markdown file but this

**[38:18]** to notice again a markdown file but this

**[38:18]** to notice again a markdown file but this is now particular to a type of task. So

**[38:21]** is now particular to a type of task. So

**[38:21]** is now particular to a type of task. So this is for creating a flask endpoint.

**[38:23]** this is for creating a flask endpoint.

**[38:23]** this is for creating a flask endpoint. And so you'll notice in here that I've

**[38:25]** And so you'll notice in here that I've

**[38:25]** And so you'll notice in here that I've given it uh information about the

**[38:27]** given it uh information about the

**[38:27]** given it uh information about the endpoint. I've given it information

**[38:29]** endpoint. I've given it information

**[38:29]** endpoint. I've given it information about my uh my unit test. I've given it

**[38:31]** about my uh my unit test. I've given it

**[38:31]** about my uh my unit test. I've given it a couple of notes about the project. And

**[38:33]** a couple of notes about the project. And

**[38:33]** a couple of notes about the project. And I've even linked to files

**[38:37]** I've even linked to files

**[38:37]** I've even linked to files that it should use as a prototype. And

**[38:39]** that it should use as a prototype. And

**[38:39]** that it should use as a prototype. And these are actually just existing files.

**[38:42]** these are actually just existing files.

**[38:42]** these are actually just existing files. So if I brought this in now, what it

**[38:45]** So if I brought this in now, what it

**[38:45]** So if I brought this in now, what it would do is it would follow all of those

**[38:47]** would do is it would follow all of those

**[38:47]** would do is it would follow all of those instructions there.

**[38:49]** instructions there.

**[38:49]** instructions there. But let's say for example with like

**[38:51]** But let's say for example with like

**[38:51]** But let's say for example with like React components just to use that as an

**[38:53]** React components just to use that as an

**[38:53]** React components just to use that as an example um that I want to make sure that

**[38:56]** example um that I want to make sure that

**[38:56]** example um that I want to make sure that React components always follow the exact

**[38:58]** React components always follow the exact

**[38:58]** React components always follow the exact same patterns and practices. So what I


### [39:00 - 40:00]

**[39:01]** same patterns and practices. So what I

**[39:01]** same patterns and practices. So what I can do there is up at the very top

**[39:04]** can do there is up at the very top

**[39:04]** can do there is up at the very top you'll notice the apply to and then I

**[39:06]** you'll notice the apply to and then I

**[39:06]** you'll notice the apply to and then I can put in a path. So I could go

**[39:08]** can put in a path. So I could go

**[39:08]** can put in a path. So I could go asterisk

**[39:10]** asterisk

**[39:10]** asterisk um um asteris JSX or TSX if you're using

**[39:15]** um um asteris JSX or TSX if you're using

**[39:15]** um um asteris JSX or TSX if you're using TypeScript. And now any time that you're

**[39:18]** TypeScript. And now any time that you're

**[39:18]** TypeScript. And now any time that you're working with a file that matches that

**[39:20]** working with a file that matches that

**[39:20]** working with a file that matches that pattern, it will then automatically

**[39:22]** pattern, it will then automatically

**[39:22]** pattern, it will then automatically apply that instructions file. So in this

**[39:24]** apply that instructions file. So in this

**[39:24]** apply that instructions file. So in this case here, it's going to look inside of

**[39:26]** case here, it's going to look inside of

**[39:26]** case here, it's going to look inside of server tests and anytime that it finds a

**[39:28]** server tests and anytime that it finds a

**[39:28]** server tests and anytime that it finds a file that matches test underscore. And

**[39:30]** file that matches test underscore. And

**[39:30]** file that matches test underscore. And you'll notice if I go into my um server

**[39:42]** tests, you'll notice test games that

**[39:42]** tests, you'll notice test games that matches that pattern right there. So

**[39:44]** matches that pattern right there. So

**[39:44]** matches that pattern right there. So anytime that I was wrong with a test

**[39:45]** anytime that I was wrong with a test

**[39:45]** anytime that I was wrong with a test file, that would then go ahead and um

**[39:48]** file, that would then go ahead and um

**[39:48]** file, that would then go ahead and um and match. The last thing I want to

**[39:49]** and match. The last thing I want to

**[39:49]** and match. The last thing I want to mention here is that all of this becomes

**[39:52]** mention here is that all of this becomes

**[39:52]** mention here is that all of this becomes part of your repository.

**[39:56]** part of your repository.

**[39:56]** part of your repository. So is creating these files going to take

**[39:58]** So is creating these files going to take

**[39:58]** So is creating these files going to take a little while? Everybody go like this.


### [40:00 - 41:00]

**[40:01]** a little while? Everybody go like this.

**[40:01]** a little while? Everybody go like this. Yeah. But this is very much like

**[40:04]** Yeah. But this is very much like

**[40:04]** Yeah. But this is very much like spending three hours to write a script

**[40:07]** spending three hours to write a script

**[40:07]** spending three hours to write a script for that task that constantly takes you

**[40:09]** for that task that constantly takes you

**[40:09]** for that task that constantly takes you a couple of minutes that after a little

**[40:11]** a couple of minutes that after a little

**[40:11]** a couple of minutes that after a little while you're going to get your money

**[40:12]** while you're going to get your money

**[40:12]** while you're going to get your money back on it, so to speak. the exact same

**[40:14]** back on it, so to speak. the exact same

**[40:14]** back on it, so to speak. the exact same thing here. So the time that you spend

**[40:16]** thing here. So the time that you spend

**[40:16]** thing here. So the time that you spend here is going to help improve

**[40:19]** here is going to help improve

**[40:19]** here is going to help improve productivity and help ensure that your

**[40:21]** productivity and help ensure that your

**[40:21]** productivity and help ensure that your code generation is going to be the way

**[40:23]** code generation is going to be the way

**[40:23]** code generation is going to be the way that you want it to be. Yeah.

**[40:35]** Yes, it does have to specifically Yeah,

**[40:35]** Yes, it does have to specifically Yeah, if you're if you're using the workflow

**[40:37]** if you're if you're using the workflow

**[40:37]** if you're if you're using the workflow for setting up coding agent, it does

**[40:38]** for setting up coding agent, it does

**[40:38]** for setting up coding agent, it does have to have that name and that is

**[40:39]** have to have that name and that is

**[40:40]** have to have that name and that is documented.


### [41:00 - 42:00]

**[41:05]** Yeah. So this is a fantastic question.

**[41:05]** Yeah. So this is a fantastic question. So um so the question is hey about these

**[41:07]** So um so the question is hey about these

**[41:07]** So um so the question is hey about these standards can we put these at at an org

**[41:09]** standards can we put these at at an org

**[41:09]** standards can we put these at at an org level and um

**[41:12]** level and um

**[41:12]** level and um yes so there's a few different ways now

**[41:14]** yes so there's a few different ways now

**[41:14]** yes so there's a few different ways now that you can approach that. Number one

**[41:16]** that you can approach that. Number one

**[41:16]** that you can approach that. Number one is there is an ability to set

**[41:17]** is there is an ability to set

**[41:17]** is there is an ability to set instructions at the org level um as

**[41:20]** instructions at the org level um as

**[41:20]** instructions at the org level um as well. So you could do it that way. Um

**[41:22]** well. So you could do it that way. Um

**[41:22]** well. So you could do it that way. Um you can also again stand up an MCP

**[41:25]** you can also again stand up an MCP

**[41:25]** you can also again stand up an MCP server in front of that and allow for

**[41:27]** server in front of that and allow for

**[41:27]** server in front of that and allow for searching that way. And then the last

**[41:29]** searching that way. And then the last

**[41:29]** searching that way. And then the last thing that I would mention and we just

**[41:30]** thing that I would mention and we just

**[41:30]** thing that I would mention and we just recently like literally yesterday I

**[41:33]** recently like literally yesterday I

**[41:33]** recently like literally yesterday I think it was um announced this is um

**[41:36]** think it was um announced this is um

**[41:36]** think it was um announced this is um copilot spaces um where this is

**[41:40]** copilot spaces um where this is

**[41:40]** copilot spaces um where this is specifically on github.com that what you

**[41:42]** specifically on github.com that what you

**[41:42]** specifically on github.com that what you can do is basically point it at at a

**[41:44]** can do is basically point it at at a

**[41:44]** can do is basically point it at at a repository point that it specific files

**[41:46]** repository point that it specific files

**[41:46]** repository point that it specific files and say hey here's our knowledge bases

**[41:49]** and say hey here's our knowledge bases

**[41:49]** and say hey here's our knowledge bases here's how we want our code to be

**[41:50]** here's how we want our code to be

**[41:50]** here's how we want our code to be created here's all of our standards

**[41:52]** created here's all of our standards

**[41:52]** created here's all of our standards here's good examples and then that way

**[41:54]** here's good examples and then that way

**[41:54]** here's good examples and then that way when a developer comes along and they do

**[41:56]** when a developer comes along and they do

**[41:56]** when a developer comes along and they do searches on github.com

**[41:58]** searches on github.com

**[41:58]** searches on github.com they'll be able to then um raise the


### [42:00 - 43:00]

**[42:01]** they'll be able to then um raise the

**[42:01]** they'll be able to then um raise the information from uh from there. You're

**[42:03]** information from uh from there. You're

**[42:03]** information from uh from there. You're welcome. There was something over here.

**[42:04]** welcome. There was something over here.

**[42:04]** welcome. There was something over here. Yeah, I'm trying my best to be as fair

**[42:07]** Yeah, I'm trying my best to be as fair

**[42:07]** Yeah, I'm trying my best to be as fair as I can.

**[42:26]** Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, that's a that's

**[42:26]** Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, that's a that's a fantastic question. So the question is

**[42:28]** a fantastic question. So the question is

**[42:28]** a fantastic question. So the question is is hey about this um um um about this

**[42:32]** is hey about this um um um about this

**[42:32]** is hey about this um um um about this workflow file um is this able to um be

**[42:36]** workflow file um is this able to um be

**[42:36]** workflow file um is this able to um be like automatically created or edited by

**[42:39]** like automatically created or edited by

**[42:39]** like automatically created or edited by copilot um and the the short answer is

**[42:42]** copilot um and the the short answer is

**[42:42]** copilot um and the the short answer is no. Um now if I was like working locally

**[42:45]** no. Um now if I was like working locally

**[42:45]** no. Um now if I was like working locally like let's say I'm not overly familiar

**[42:47]** like let's say I'm not overly familiar

**[42:47]** like let's say I'm not overly familiar with actions which I'm not. Um then I

**[42:50]** with actions which I'm not. Um then I

**[42:50]** with actions which I'm not. Um then I could go in through Copilot manual and I

**[42:53]** could go in through Copilot manual and I

**[42:53]** could go in through Copilot manual and I could say hey I need to create an

**[42:54]** could say hey I need to create an

**[42:54]** could say hey I need to create an environment that's going to install this

**[42:56]** environment that's going to install this

**[42:56]** environment that's going to install this this and this um and let co-pilot

**[42:58]** this and this um and let co-pilot

**[42:58]** this and this um and let co-pilot generate this for me. Absolutely. But


### [43:00 - 44:00]

**[43:00]** generate this for me. Absolutely. But

**[43:00]** generate this for me. Absolutely. But once I launch this in agent mode um

**[43:02]** once I launch this in agent mode um

**[43:02]** once I launch this in agent mode um agent mode is not going to be going back

**[43:04]** agent mode is not going to be going back

**[43:04]** agent mode is not going to be going back in and editing that. Now keep in mind um

**[43:08]** in and editing that. Now keep in mind um

**[43:08]** in and editing that. Now keep in mind um and I'm going to kind of lead this right

**[43:10]** and I'm going to kind of lead this right

**[43:10]** and I'm going to kind of lead this right into um the next um kind of like logical

**[43:13]** into um the next um kind of like logical

**[43:13]** into um the next um kind of like logical question here. Um, so keep in mind that

**[43:16]** question here. Um, so keep in mind that

**[43:16]** question here. Um, so keep in mind that agent mode or uh coding agent, so when

**[43:19]** agent mode or uh coding agent, so when

**[43:19]** agent mode or uh coding agent, so when it's doing its thing in the background

**[43:20]** it's doing its thing in the background

**[43:20]** it's doing its thing in the background here, it does have an ability to like

**[43:22]** here, it does have an ability to like

**[43:22]** here, it does have an ability to like run scripts. Um, so it can like run

**[43:25]** run scripts. Um, so it can like run

**[43:25]** run scripts. Um, so it can like run tests and things like that. And in fact,

**[43:26]** tests and things like that. And in fact,

**[43:26]** tests and things like that. And in fact, if I

**[43:28]** if I

**[43:28]** if I [Music]

**[43:36]** um where was I? Um

**[43:36]** um where was I? Um here

**[43:43]** and here

**[43:43]** and here and

**[43:49]** let me scroll on down to view session

**[43:49]** let me scroll on down to view session here.

**[43:59]** I'm going to zoom out um because

**[43:59]** I'm going to zoom out um because ironically I think it's going to make it


### [44:00 - 45:00]

**[44:01]** ironically I think it's going to make it

**[44:01]** ironically I think it's going to make it a little easier to read. Okay, let me

**[44:02]** a little easier to read. Okay, let me

**[44:02]** a little easier to read. Okay, let me come down here.

**[44:04]** come down here.

**[44:04]** come down here. Um,

**[44:24]** Yeah. So, um,

**[44:24]** Yeah. So, um, yeah, it looks like all the tests fail,

**[44:26]** yeah, it looks like all the tests fail,

**[44:26]** yeah, it looks like all the tests fail, although we're getting um Oh, that's

**[44:29]** although we're getting um Oh, that's

**[44:29]** although we're getting um Oh, that's cool. They pushed an update um to SQL

**[44:31]** cool. They pushed an update um to SQL

**[44:31]** cool. They pushed an update um to SQL Alchemy. I'll have to go back and now

**[44:33]** Alchemy. I'll have to go back and now

**[44:33]** Alchemy. I'll have to go back and now update the project. Um, but in any

**[44:34]** update the project. Um, but in any

**[44:34]** update the project. Um, but in any event, um, the takeaway that I want you

**[44:36]** event, um, the takeaway that I want you

**[44:36]** event, um, the takeaway that I want you to get out of this is, um, the fact that

**[44:39]** to get out of this is, um, the fact that

**[44:39]** to get out of this is, um, the fact that this is running commands locally. Okay.

**[44:44]** this is running commands locally. Okay.

**[44:44]** this is running commands locally. Okay. And so that then kind of raises um, a

**[44:46]** And so that then kind of raises um, a

**[44:46]** And so that then kind of raises um, a next big question which I think is very

**[44:48]** next big question which I think is very

**[44:48]** next big question which I think is very directly related to, hey, could it go in

**[44:50]** directly related to, hey, could it go in

**[44:50]** directly related to, hey, could it go in and like modify that um that that that

**[44:52]** and like modify that um that that that

**[44:52]** and like modify that um that that that initial set of workflow? Um, and there's

**[44:55]** initial set of workflow? Um, and there's

**[44:55]** initial set of workflow? Um, and there's it it it it can't modify that. Um and it

**[44:59]** it it it it can't modify that. Um and it

**[44:59]** it it it it can't modify that. Um and it also is not able to access any external


### [45:00 - 46:00]

**[45:02]** also is not able to access any external

**[45:02]** also is not able to access any external resources. So let me uplevel this real

**[45:03]** resources. So let me uplevel this real

**[45:04]** resources. So let me uplevel this real quick. Um when it comes to coding agent,

**[45:06]** quick. Um when it comes to coding agent,

**[45:06]** quick. Um when it comes to coding agent, coding agent was very much built with

**[45:09]** coding agent was very much built with

**[45:09]** coding agent was very much built with security in mind. So the first big thing

**[45:12]** security in mind. So the first big thing

**[45:12]** security in mind. So the first big thing is it's built on top of GitHub actions.

**[45:15]** is it's built on top of GitHub actions.

**[45:15]** is it's built on top of GitHub actions. And if you're not already familiar with

**[45:16]** And if you're not already familiar with

**[45:16]** And if you're not already familiar with GitHub actions, when you spin up a brand

**[45:19]** GitHub actions, when you spin up a brand

**[45:19]** GitHub actions, when you spin up a brand new action to start running, it does so

**[45:22]** new action to start running, it does so

**[45:22]** new action to start running, it does so in an ephemeral space. So it creates the

**[45:25]** in an ephemeral space. So it creates the

**[45:25]** in an ephemeral space. So it creates the one space that it's going to work in.

**[45:27]** one space that it's going to work in.

**[45:27]** one space that it's going to work in. does all of its work in there and then

**[45:28]** does all of its work in there and then

**[45:28]** does all of its work in there and then once that's done all of that's torn

**[45:30]** once that's done all of that's torn

**[45:30]** once that's done all of that's torn down. So that's the only space in which

**[45:33]** down. So that's the only space in which

**[45:33]** down. So that's the only space in which it can work. Copilot only has read

**[45:36]** it can work. Copilot only has read

**[45:36]** it can work. Copilot only has read access to your repository save for the

**[45:40]** access to your repository save for the

**[45:40]** access to your repository save for the branch that it's going to create and it

**[45:43]** branch that it's going to create and it

**[45:43]** branch that it's going to create and it only has right access to that branch. So

**[45:46]** only has right access to that branch. So

**[45:46]** only has right access to that branch. So in this case here it's going to be

**[45:47]** in this case here it's going to be

**[45:47]** in this case here it's going to be copilot-fix-2.

**[45:49]** copilot-fix-2.

**[45:50]** copilot-fix-2. Um, copilot-fix is what it's always

**[45:52]** Um, copilot-fix is what it's always

**[45:52]** Um, copilot-fix is what it's always going to start with dash and then the

**[45:54]** going to start with dash and then the

**[45:54]** going to start with dash and then the number of the issue that was assigned

**[45:56]** number of the issue that was assigned

**[45:56]** number of the issue that was assigned to. I'm going to Yep. Um, so um, uh, so


### [46:00 - 47:00]

**[46:00]** to. I'm going to Yep. Um, so um, uh, so

**[46:00]** to. I'm going to Yep. Um, so um, uh, so in this case it was issue number two. So

**[46:02]** in this case it was issue number two. So

**[46:02]** in this case it was issue number two. So that's why it's copilot- fix. So that's

**[46:04]** that's why it's copilot- fix. So that's

**[46:04]** that's why it's copilot- fix. So that's the only thing that it's going to have

**[46:05]** the only thing that it's going to have

**[46:05]** the only thing that it's going to have right access to. On top of that, it does

**[46:09]** right access to. On top of that, it does

**[46:09]** right access to. On top of that, it does not have access to any external services

**[46:13]** not have access to any external services

**[46:13]** not have access to any external services unless you open up the firewall. So the

**[46:16]** unless you open up the firewall. So the

**[46:16]** unless you open up the firewall. So the firewall is going to be completely

**[46:18]** firewall is going to be completely

**[46:18]** firewall is going to be completely locked down. it is not able to call the

**[46:20]** locked down. it is not able to call the

**[46:20]** locked down. it is not able to call the outside world. That includes by the way

**[46:23]** outside world. That includes by the way

**[46:23]** outside world. That includes by the way installing packages.

**[46:25]** installing packages.

**[46:25]** installing packages. So like let's say there was a library

**[46:27]** So like let's say there was a library

**[46:27]** So like let's say there was a library that needed to be installed and it tries

**[46:28]** that needed to be installed and it tries

**[46:28]** that needed to be installed and it tries to install that. It's going to fail on

**[46:30]** to install that. It's going to fail on

**[46:30]** to install that. It's going to fail on that unless I've specifically punched

**[46:32]** that unless I've specifically punched

**[46:32]** that unless I've specifically punched open a hole on that. Now the exception

**[46:35]** open a hole on that. Now the exception

**[46:35]** open a hole on that. Now the exception to that the workflow that I create that

**[46:38]** to that the workflow that I create that

**[46:38]** to that the workflow that I create that that uh that that initial setup workflow

**[46:40]** that uh that that initial setup workflow

**[46:40]** that uh that that initial setup workflow that we talked about that workflow

**[46:42]** that we talked about that workflow

**[46:42]** that we talked about that workflow because now I can install those

**[46:43]** because now I can install those

**[46:43]** because now I can install those services. So if there's anything that I

**[46:44]** services. So if there's anything that I

**[46:44]** services. So if there's anything that I know that it needs, then I can go ahead

**[46:45]** know that it needs, then I can go ahead

**[46:46]** know that it needs, then I can go ahead and do that. But otherwise, it's not

**[46:47]** and do that. But otherwise, it's not

**[46:47]** and do that. But otherwise, it's not going to have access to any external

**[46:49]** going to have access to any external

**[46:49]** going to have access to any external resources. So very much designed with

**[46:52]** resources. So very much designed with

**[46:52]** resources. So very much designed with that uh with that security in mind. So

**[46:54]** that uh with that security in mind. So

**[46:54]** that uh with that security in mind. So very long-winded answer, but there's

**[46:55]** very long-winded answer, but there's

**[46:55]** very long-winded answer, but there's everything you ever wanted to know.

**[46:57]** everything you ever wanted to know.

**[46:57]** everything you ever wanted to know. Yeah.


### [47:00 - 48:00]

**[47:09]** Yeah. So let's actually go kind of one

**[47:09]** Yeah. So let's actually go kind of one one step further with this. So, um I am

**[47:12]** one step further with this. So, um I am

**[47:12]** one step further with this. So, um I am a um uh I'm a good steward of my um

**[47:18]** a um uh I'm a good steward of my um

**[47:18]** a um uh I'm a good steward of my um um of my repository. And so when I

**[47:21]** um of my repository. And so when I

**[47:21]** um of my repository. And so when I create a PR into main, so I'm going to

**[47:23]** create a PR into main, so I'm going to

**[47:23]** create a PR into main, so I'm going to use this one here, dependabot wanting to

**[47:25]** use this one here, dependabot wanting to

**[47:25]** use this one here, dependabot wanting to uh to bump a version number. And we're

**[47:27]** uh to bump a version number. And we're

**[47:27]** uh to bump a version number. And we're going to notice

**[47:32]** we're going to notice

**[47:32]** we're going to notice there we go. Um that I have um uh a

**[47:37]** there we go. Um that I have um uh a

**[47:37]** there we go. Um that I have um uh a workflow set up here to perform some

**[47:39]** workflow set up here to perform some

**[47:39]** workflow set up here to perform some testing. So it runs unit tests and it

**[47:41]** testing. So it runs unit tests and it

**[47:41]** testing. So it runs unit tests and it runs some endto-end tests. So um that

**[47:44]** runs some endto-end tests. So um that

**[47:44]** runs some endto-end tests. So um that way somebody goes in, they create a a

**[47:46]** way somebody goes in, they create a a

**[47:46]** way somebody goes in, they create a a pull request and we're going to confirm

**[47:47]** pull request and we're going to confirm

**[47:47]** pull request and we're going to confirm all of that. Every organization should

**[47:50]** all of that. Every organization should

**[47:50]** all of that. Every organization should hopefully have some level of validation

**[47:53]** hopefully have some level of validation

**[47:53]** hopefully have some level of validation that PRs look good before they start

**[47:55]** that PRs look good before they start

**[47:55]** that PRs look good before they start merging them in. Right? Everybody go

**[47:56]** merging them in. Right? Everybody go

**[47:56]** merging them in. Right? Everybody go like this. Please lie to me if you have

**[47:58]** like this. Please lie to me if you have

**[47:58]** like this. Please lie to me if you have to. Fantastic. Now, um here's the catch.


### [48:00 - 49:00]

**[48:02]** to. Fantastic. Now, um here's the catch.

**[48:02]** to. Fantastic. Now, um here's the catch. Again, thinking with our our security

**[48:04]** Again, thinking with our our security

**[48:04]** Again, thinking with our our security cap, um I want to make sure that that

**[48:07]** cap, um I want to make sure that that

**[48:08]** cap, um I want to make sure that that any of that code is always going to be

**[48:09]** any of that code is always going to be

**[48:09]** any of that code is always going to be something that that that I trust. So

**[48:11]** something that that that I trust. So

**[48:11]** something that that that I trust. So hopefully anyway, I can trust all my

**[48:13]** hopefully anyway, I can trust all my

**[48:13]** hopefully anyway, I can trust all my developers, but when it comes to AI, I'm

**[48:16]** developers, but when it comes to AI, I'm

**[48:16]** developers, but when it comes to AI, I'm not entirely certain. So what we'll

**[48:19]** not entirely certain. So what we'll

**[48:19]** not entirely certain. So what we'll notice is that here's the PR that it

**[48:21]** notice is that here's the PR that it

**[48:22]** notice is that here's the PR that it finished. And you'll notice if I scroll

**[48:25]** finished. And you'll notice if I scroll

**[48:25]** finished. And you'll notice if I scroll on down here and I get to that section

**[48:29]** on down here and I get to that section

**[48:29]** on down here and I get to that section on workflows that it has not run those

**[48:33]** on workflows that it has not run those

**[48:33]** on workflows that it has not run those tests. And it's only going to run those

**[48:36]** tests. And it's only going to run those

**[48:36]** tests. And it's only going to run those tests if I click that button right

**[48:38]** tests if I click that button right

**[48:38]** tests if I click that button right there. And of course before I do that, I

**[48:40]** there. And of course before I do that, I

**[48:40]** there. And of course before I do that, I should go in and review the code and

**[48:42]** should go in and review the code and

**[48:42]** should go in and review the code and everything else there. So yeah.


### [49:00 - 50:00]

**[49:02]** Exactly. Yeah. So, so the question is is

**[49:02]** Exactly. Yeah. So, so the question is is um so co-pilot when it did its work

**[49:06]** um so co-pilot when it did its work

**[49:06]** um so co-pilot when it did its work behind the scenes and we saw this

**[49:07]** behind the scenes and we saw this

**[49:07]** behind the scenes and we saw this already that it ran all of those unit

**[49:09]** already that it ran all of those unit

**[49:09]** already that it ran all of those unit tests locally and then now we're going

**[49:12]** tests locally and then now we're going

**[49:12]** tests locally and then now we're going to notice here that I'm going to have it

**[49:14]** to notice here that I'm going to have it

**[49:14]** to notice here that I'm going to have it run those unit tests again. I I do the

**[49:16]** run those unit tests again. I I do the

**[49:16]** run those unit tests again. I I do the exact same thing with co-pilot as I do

**[49:19]** exact same thing with co-pilot as I do

**[49:19]** exact same thing with co-pilot as I do with all of my other developers, which

**[49:22]** with all of my other developers, which

**[49:22]** with all of my other developers, which is that that bounce and suspenders

**[49:25]** is that that bounce and suspenders

**[49:25]** is that that bounce and suspenders approach. So

**[49:27]** approach. So

**[49:27]** approach. So I'm going to uplevel this again. Just

**[49:30]** I'm going to uplevel this again. Just

**[49:30]** I'm going to uplevel this again. Just because I introduce AI does not mean

**[49:32]** because I introduce AI does not mean

**[49:32]** because I introduce AI does not mean that any of the fundamentals of DevOps

**[49:35]** that any of the fundamentals of DevOps

**[49:35]** that any of the fundamentals of DevOps change. So let's think about how I wrote

**[49:38]** change. So let's think about how I wrote

**[49:38]** change. So let's think about how I wrote code before AI. So some of it would be

**[49:40]** code before AI. So some of it would be

**[49:40]** code before AI. So some of it would be from my own knowledge. Some of it would

**[49:43]** from my own knowledge. Some of it would

**[49:43]** from my own knowledge. Some of it would be grabbed from documentation. Some of

**[49:45]** be grabbed from documentation. Some of

**[49:45]** be grabbed from documentation. Some of it would be copied and pasted from Stack

**[49:47]** it would be copied and pasted from Stack

**[49:47]** it would be copied and pasted from Stack Overflow and changing it and hoping and

**[49:49]** Overflow and changing it and hoping and

**[49:49]** Overflow and changing it and hoping and praying that it actually did what I

**[49:50]** praying that it actually did what I

**[49:50]** praying that it actually did what I wanted it to do. Or maybe that's just

**[49:53]** wanted it to do. Or maybe that's just

**[49:53]** wanted it to do. Or maybe that's just me.

**[49:54]** me.

**[49:54]** me. Um, and then eventually I'm going to go

**[49:57]** Um, and then eventually I'm going to go

**[49:57]** Um, and then eventually I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run my test

**[49:58]** ahead and I'm going to run my test

**[49:58]** ahead and I'm going to run my test locally, hope that all of them work, and


### [50:00 - 51:00]

**[50:01]** locally, hope that all of them work, and

**[50:01]** locally, hope that all of them work, and then I'm going to create a PR.

**[50:03]** then I'm going to create a PR.

**[50:03]** then I'm going to create a PR. Now, after we do that PR, now what are

**[50:05]** Now, after we do that PR, now what are

**[50:05]** Now, after we do that PR, now what are we going to do? Well, we're going to get

**[50:07]** we going to do? Well, we're going to get

**[50:07]** we going to do? Well, we're going to get another developer to come along and

**[50:08]** another developer to come along and

**[50:08]** another developer to come along and review the code. We're going to run all

**[50:11]** review the code. We're going to run all

**[50:11]** review the code. We're going to run all of our actions, and we're going to make

**[50:12]** of our actions, and we're going to make

**[50:12]** of our actions, and we're going to make sure that our tests pass, that our

**[50:14]** sure that our tests pass, that our

**[50:14]** sure that our tests pass, that our llinters check out, that all of our

**[50:16]** llinters check out, that all of our

**[50:16]** llinters check out, that all of our security scans are run, that we're going

**[50:18]** security scans are run, that we're going

**[50:18]** security scans are run, that we're going to do all of those core fundamentals

**[50:22]** to do all of those core fundamentals

**[50:22]** to do all of those core fundamentals regardless of how my code is being

**[50:24]** regardless of how my code is being

**[50:24]** regardless of how my code is being generated. And that doesn't change when

**[50:26]** generated. And that doesn't change when

**[50:26]** generated. And that doesn't change when I'm using AI. So, is AI run those tests

**[50:28]** I'm using AI. So, is AI run those tests

**[50:28]** I'm using AI. So, is AI run those tests locally? Absolutely. But am I still

**[50:30]** locally? Absolutely. But am I still

**[50:30]** locally? Absolutely. But am I still going to go in and double check? I

**[50:32]** going to go in and double check? I

**[50:32]** going to go in and double check? I absolutely am. So, I'm going to do that

**[50:34]** absolutely am. So, I'm going to do that

**[50:34]** absolutely am. So, I'm going to do that here as well.

**[50:56]** Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. So

**[50:56]** Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. So that um like let's say I'm working on a

**[50:58]** that um like let's say I'm working on a

**[50:58]** that um like let's say I'm working on a larger project and admittedly this is a


### [51:00 - 52:00]

**[51:00]** larger project and admittedly this is a

**[51:00]** larger project and admittedly this is a smaller project. So like when I run my

**[51:01]** smaller project. So like when I run my

**[51:01]** smaller project. So like when I run my my unit test or even my even my end to

**[51:03]** my unit test or even my even my end to

**[51:03]** my unit test or even my even my end to end test, you know, it's going to take

**[51:04]** end test, you know, it's going to take

**[51:04]** end test, you know, it's going to take like 30 40 seconds. Um, but if you've

**[51:07]** like 30 40 seconds. Um, but if you've

**[51:07]** like 30 40 seconds. Um, but if you've got a larger project where now that's

**[51:08]** got a larger project where now that's

**[51:08]** got a larger project where now that's going to be taking minutes. Um, so in

**[51:11]** going to be taking minutes. Um, so in

**[51:11]** going to be taking minutes. Um, so in agent mode then I can go ahead and

**[51:13]** agent mode then I can go ahead and

**[51:13]** agent mode then I can go ahead and direct it like hey only run the tests on

**[51:16]** direct it like hey only run the tests on

**[51:16]** direct it like hey only run the tests on what you're working on until you get to

**[51:18]** what you're working on until you get to

**[51:18]** what you're working on until you get to the very end and then go ahead and run

**[51:21]** the very end and then go ahead and run

**[51:21]** the very end and then go ahead and run everything. So I could either just

**[51:23]** everything. So I could either just

**[51:23]** everything. So I could either just include that in the prompt again don't

**[51:24]** include that in the prompt again don't

**[51:24]** include that in the prompt again don't be pass aggressive or co-pilot. You want

**[51:26]** be pass aggressive or co-pilot. You want

**[51:26]** be pass aggressive or co-pilot. You want it to do something tell it to do it. Um

**[51:28]** it to do something tell it to do it. Um

**[51:28]** it to do something tell it to do it. Um that might also be something that I

**[51:29]** that might also be something that I

**[51:30]** that might also be something that I would consider including in the

**[51:31]** would consider including in the

**[51:31]** would consider including in the instructions file of like hey you know

**[51:34]** instructions file of like hey you know

**[51:34]** instructions file of like hey you know make sure that you always do that. Um,

**[51:36]** make sure that you always do that. Um,

**[51:36]** make sure that you always do that. Um, and then on top of that, one of the

**[51:38]** and then on top of that, one of the

**[51:38]** and then on top of that, one of the things that I've I've noticed about um,

**[51:41]** things that I've I've noticed about um,

**[51:41]** things that I've I've noticed about um, Claude 4 or Claude Sonnet 4 or whatever

**[51:43]** Claude 4 or Claude Sonnet 4 or whatever

**[51:43]** Claude 4 or Claude Sonnet 4 or whatever the naming structure it is they're using

**[51:45]** the naming structure it is they're using

**[51:45]** the naming structure it is they're using um, on that is it tends to sort of like

**[51:48]** um, on that is it tends to sort of like

**[51:48]** um, on that is it tends to sort of like do that on its own where it will go

**[51:51]** do that on its own where it will go

**[51:51]** do that on its own where it will go ahead and like run a smaller set of

**[51:52]** ahead and like run a smaller set of

**[51:52]** ahead and like run a smaller set of tests and then like branch out and do

**[51:53]** tests and then like branch out and do

**[51:54]** tests and then like branch out and do the whole one. Um, which it it's doing

**[51:57]** the whole one. Um, which it it's doing

**[51:57]** the whole one. Um, which it it's doing that on its own. But again, like if you

**[51:58]** that on its own. But again, like if you

**[51:58]** that on its own. But again, like if you wanted to do something specifically,


### [52:00 - 53:00]

**[52:00]** wanted to do something specifically,

**[52:00]** wanted to do something specifically, always tell it. Always tell it. All

**[52:02]** always tell it. Always tell it. All

**[52:02]** always tell it. Always tell it. All right, I'm going to go over to this side

**[52:03]** right, I'm going to go over to this side

**[52:03]** right, I'm going to go over to this side real quick and I'll come back to the

**[52:04]** real quick and I'll come back to the

**[52:04]** real quick and I'll come back to the middle. Yeah.

**[52:15]** Does Copilot? Yes. Yeah. Copilot does

**[52:16]** Does Copilot? Yes. Yeah. Copilot does support uh remote MCP servers. Um if

**[52:18]** support uh remote MCP servers. Um if

**[52:18]** support uh remote MCP servers. Um if you're going to be using that with

**[52:19]** you're going to be using that with

**[52:19]** you're going to be using that with coding agent, it will support that with

**[52:21]** coding agent, it will support that with

**[52:21]** coding agent, it will support that with coding agent as well, but I need to open

**[52:24]** coding agent as well, but I need to open

**[52:24]** coding agent as well, but I need to open up a hole in the firewall for it to be

**[52:26]** up a hole in the firewall for it to be

**[52:26]** up a hole in the firewall for it to be able to access that remote service.

**[52:39]** Yes. Yeah. Uh that uh right here if I go

**[52:39]** Yes. Yeah. Uh that uh right here if I go to

**[52:44]** settings

**[52:44]** settings and

**[52:46]** and

**[52:46]** and I go to

**[52:49]** I go to

**[52:49]** I go to um coding agent.

**[52:52]** um coding agent.

**[52:52]** um coding agent. There's my MCP. I can go ahead and set

**[52:56]** There's my MCP. I can go ahead and set

**[52:56]** There's my MCP. I can go ahead and set the the the list my MCP servers there.

**[52:58]** the the the list my MCP servers there.

**[52:58]** the the the list my MCP servers there. and then


### [53:00 - 54:00]

**[53:01]** and then

**[53:01]** and then um environments

**[53:13]** and then um copilot in here. There's um

**[53:13]** and then um copilot in here. There's um um there's different uh variables that

**[53:15]** um there's different uh variables that

**[53:15]** um there's different uh variables that you could then go ahead and set to open

**[53:17]** you could then go ahead and set to open

**[53:17]** you could then go ahead and set to open up your firewall. All that's in in the

**[53:19]** up your firewall. All that's in in the

**[53:19]** up your firewall. All that's in in the documentation, but that's where you

**[53:21]** documentation, but that's where you

**[53:21]** documentation, but that's where you would go to to go ahead and do that.

**[53:23]** would go to to go ahead and do that.

**[53:23]** would go to to go ahead and do that. You're welcome. Yeah.

**[53:35]** Correct.

**[53:35]** Correct. [Laughter]

**[53:37]** [Laughter]

**[53:37]** [Laughter] Yeah.

**[53:45]** Yeah. So, so the question is is hey,

**[53:45]** Yeah. So, so the question is is hey, we're using ADO, we're using Jira, we're

**[53:47]** we're using ADO, we're using Jira, we're

**[53:47]** we're using ADO, we're using Jira, we're using, you know, fill in the blank for

**[53:48]** using, you know, fill in the blank for

**[53:48]** using, you know, fill in the blank for managing our issues. Um, how can I then

**[53:51]** managing our issues. Um, how can I then

**[53:51]** managing our issues. Um, how can I then use that to assign a co-pilot?

**[53:53]** use that to assign a co-pilot?

**[53:53]** use that to assign a co-pilot? Fortunately, um as of right now, um it's

**[53:55]** Fortunately, um as of right now, um it's

**[53:55]** Fortunately, um as of right now, um it's going to be GitHub only. Um I don't know

**[53:58]** going to be GitHub only. Um I don't know

**[53:58]** going to be GitHub only. Um I don't know whether or not it will stay GitHub only


### [54:00 - 55:00]

**[54:00]** whether or not it will stay GitHub only

**[54:00]** whether or not it will stay GitHub only or what a future plan might look like.

**[54:02]** or what a future plan might look like.

**[54:02]** or what a future plan might look like. Um but uh but yeah, now one thing that

**[54:05]** Um but uh but yeah, now one thing that

**[54:05]** Um but uh but yeah, now one thing that you might want to consider um is um if

**[54:09]** you might want to consider um is um if

**[54:09]** you might want to consider um is um if there is something in Jira that you want

**[54:11]** there is something in Jira that you want

**[54:11]** there is something in Jira that you want to assign to to Copilot, you could

**[54:13]** to assign to to Copilot, you could

**[54:13]** to assign to to Copilot, you could create a relatively straightforward

**[54:14]** create a relatively straightforward

**[54:14]** create a relatively straightforward script to just like copy that issue over

**[54:17]** script to just like copy that issue over

**[54:17]** script to just like copy that issue over um and then go ahead and and assign it

**[54:19]** um and then go ahead and and assign it

**[54:19]** um and then go ahead and and assign it to uh to Copilot from uh from there. But

**[54:21]** to uh to Copilot from uh from there. But

**[54:21]** to uh to Copilot from uh from there. But right now, the issue does have to be

**[54:23]** right now, the issue does have to be

**[54:23]** right now, the issue does have to be inside of uh inside of GitHub.

**[54:57]** Yeah. So um this is a fantastic

**[54:57]** Yeah. So um this is a fantastic question. I'm going to um actually

**[54:59]** question. I'm going to um actually

**[54:59]** question. I'm going to um actually uplevel this. So the question is is hey


### [55:00 - 56:00]

**[55:02]** uplevel this. So the question is is hey

**[55:02]** uplevel this. So the question is is hey we have um internal libraries and those

**[55:05]** we have um internal libraries and those

**[55:05]** we have um internal libraries and those are created in different uh repos and we

**[55:07]** are created in different uh repos and we

**[55:07]** are created in different uh repos and we want to make sure that copilot's going

**[55:09]** want to make sure that copilot's going

**[55:09]** want to make sure that copilot's going to use those um uh those external

**[55:13]** to use those um uh those external

**[55:13]** to use those um uh those external libraries when it goes in to to do its

**[55:15]** libraries when it goes in to to do its

**[55:15]** libraries when it goes in to to do its code. So um first thing that you can do

**[55:19]** code. So um first thing that you can do

**[55:19]** code. So um first thing that you can do um is

**[55:21]** um is

**[55:21]** um is make sure that copilot sees you doing

**[55:24]** make sure that copilot sees you doing

**[55:24]** make sure that copilot sees you doing it. So, Copilot is a great pattern

**[55:27]** it. So, Copilot is a great pattern

**[55:27]** it. So, Copilot is a great pattern matcher and in order for Copilot to be

**[55:30]** matcher and in order for Copilot to be

**[55:30]** matcher and in order for Copilot to be able to use an external library or an

**[55:33]** able to use an external library or an

**[55:33]** able to use an external library or an external framework, it just needs to see

**[55:35]** external framework, it just needs to see

**[55:35]** external framework, it just needs to see how you're doing it. Like, think about

**[55:37]** how you're doing it. Like, think about

**[55:37]** how you're doing it. Like, think about all the frameworks that you use on a

**[55:39]** all the frameworks that you use on a

**[55:39]** all the frameworks that you use on a day-to-day basis. Do you really know how

**[55:41]** day-to-day basis. Do you really know how

**[55:41]** day-to-day basis. Do you really know how they work behind the scenes? Like, I'm

**[55:43]** they work behind the scenes? Like, I'm

**[55:43]** they work behind the scenes? Like, I'm I'm a Spelt developer. I have no idea

**[55:45]** I'm a Spelt developer. I have no idea

**[55:45]** I'm a Spelt developer. I have no idea how spelt works behind the scenes, but I

**[55:47]** how spelt works behind the scenes, but I

**[55:47]** how spelt works behind the scenes, but I know how to use spelt because I've read

**[55:49]** know how to use spelt because I've read

**[55:49]** know how to use spelt because I've read all the docs and I've written all the

**[55:51]** all the docs and I've written all the

**[55:51]** all the docs and I've written all the code and and and I can get it to do

**[55:52]** code and and and I can get it to do

**[55:52]** code and and and I can get it to do everything that I want it to do, but I

**[55:54]** everything that I want it to do, but I

**[55:54]** everything that I want it to do, but I have no idea what it's doing behind the

**[55:55]** have no idea what it's doing behind the

**[55:56]** have no idea what it's doing behind the scenes. I want to think of the exact

**[55:57]** scenes. I want to think of the exact

**[55:57]** scenes. I want to think of the exact same thing when it comes to copilot.

**[55:59]** same thing when it comes to copilot.

**[55:59]** same thing when it comes to copilot. Copilot doesn't need to see the source


### [56:00 - 57:00]

**[56:00]** Copilot doesn't need to see the source

**[56:00]** Copilot doesn't need to see the source code. It just needs to see how you're

**[56:03]** code. It just needs to see how you're

**[56:03]** code. It just needs to see how you're using it and then it can best understand

**[56:06]** using it and then it can best understand

**[56:06]** using it and then it can best understand then in turn how to um um how to do

**[56:09]** then in turn how to um um how to do

**[56:09]** then in turn how to um um how to do that. So um that's the first big thing

**[56:12]** that. So um that's the first big thing

**[56:12]** that. So um that's the first big thing is like show it examples of that. The

**[56:15]** is like show it examples of that. The

**[56:15]** is like show it examples of that. The next thing that you can then do is again

**[56:17]** next thing that you can then do is again

**[56:17]** next thing that you can then do is again take advantage of your instructions

**[56:19]** take advantage of your instructions

**[56:19]** take advantage of your instructions files. So um what you can do is just

**[56:23]** files. So um what you can do is just

**[56:23]** files. So um what you can do is just list the API. So if I um if I'm using um

**[56:28]** list the API. So if I um if I'm using um

**[56:28]** list the API. So if I um if I'm using um a particular library and I know that

**[56:30]** a particular library and I know that

**[56:30]** a particular library and I know that there's always like certain file types

**[56:32]** there's always like certain file types

**[56:32]** there's always like certain file types that are going to be using that then I

**[56:33]** that are going to be using that then I

**[56:33]** that are going to be using that then I could create that that instructions file

**[56:35]** could create that that instructions file

**[56:35]** could create that that instructions file or I could list that inside my

**[56:36]** or I could list that inside my

**[56:36]** or I could list that inside my instructions file. Or again, if it's a

**[56:38]** instructions file. Or again, if it's a

**[56:38]** instructions file. Or again, if it's a bigger set of libraries, put an MCP

**[56:41]** bigger set of libraries, put an MCP

**[56:41]** bigger set of libraries, put an MCP server in front of it and then I can go

**[56:42]** server in front of it and then I can go

**[56:42]** server in front of it and then I can go ahead and allow it to to search that way

**[56:44]** ahead and allow it to to search that way

**[56:44]** ahead and allow it to to search that way and be able to to see it um to see it

**[56:47]** and be able to to see it um to see it

**[56:47]** and be able to to see it um to see it that way. So, kind of show it how it is

**[56:49]** that way. So, kind of show it how it is

**[56:49]** that way. So, kind of show it how it is that um uh that that that that you're

**[56:51]** that um uh that that that that you're

**[56:51]** that um uh that that that that you're using it. Um

**[56:59]** and there was something else that I

**[56:59]** and there was something else that I wanted to add there that will come to me


### [57:00 - 58:00]

**[57:02]** wanted to add there that will come to me

**[57:02]** wanted to add there that will come to me um in a minute.

**[57:12]** there's something else and I just cannot

**[57:12]** there's something else and I just cannot remember what it is now. But yeah, so

**[57:21]** yeah, you um so this is a great

**[57:21]** yeah, you um so this is a great question. So um what about fine-tuning?

**[57:24]** question. So um what about fine-tuning?

**[57:24]** question. So um what about fine-tuning? And the short answer is right now um we

**[57:27]** And the short answer is right now um we

**[57:27]** And the short answer is right now um we we don't uh support fine-tuning. Um,

**[57:30]** we don't uh support fine-tuning. Um,

**[57:30]** we don't uh support fine-tuning. Um, fine-tuning, as it turns out, is is very

**[57:34]** fine-tuning, as it turns out, is is very

**[57:34]** fine-tuning, as it turns out, is is very tricky because one of the things that

**[57:36]** tricky because one of the things that

**[57:36]** tricky because one of the things that we've discovered in like working with

**[57:37]** we've discovered in like working with

**[57:37]** we've discovered in like working with customers and so forth is customers have

**[57:39]** customers and so forth is customers have

**[57:39]** customers and so forth is customers have code bases where they're proud of a lot

**[57:41]** code bases where they're proud of a lot

**[57:41]** code bases where they're proud of a lot of it

**[57:43]** of it

**[57:43]** of it and then they've got a lot of it that

**[57:44]** and then they've got a lot of it that

**[57:44]** and then they've got a lot of it that they're not necessarily proud of. And so

**[57:46]** they're not necessarily proud of. And so

**[57:46]** they're not necessarily proud of. And so training copilot to understand, hey,

**[57:49]** training copilot to understand, hey,

**[57:49]** training copilot to understand, hey, this is the good stuff. This is the

**[57:51]** this is the good stuff. This is the

**[57:51]** this is the good stuff. This is the stuff you don't want to look at. Um,

**[57:54]** stuff you don't want to look at. Um,

**[57:54]** stuff you don't want to look at. Um, becomes a little tricky. So, this is

**[57:56]** becomes a little tricky. So, this is

**[57:56]** becomes a little tricky. So, this is again where standing like a uh up an MCP

**[57:58]** again where standing like a uh up an MCP

**[57:58]** again where standing like a uh up an MCP server really comes into play because


### [58:00 - 59:00]

**[58:00]** server really comes into play because

**[58:00]** server really comes into play because now I can then better control this is

**[58:03]** now I can then better control this is

**[58:03]** now I can then better control this is what I want you to be looking at. This

**[58:04]** what I want you to be looking at. This

**[58:04]** what I want you to be looking at. This is what I don't want you to be uh to be

**[58:06]** is what I don't want you to be uh to be

**[58:06]** is what I don't want you to be uh to be looking at. So, yeah.

**[58:32]** I I am not a billing person. I am going

**[58:32]** I I am not a billing person. I am going to

**[58:40]** let Oh, I was looking at this clock

**[58:40]** let Oh, I was looking at this clock right here. I thought I had six minutes.

**[58:42]** right here. I thought I had six minutes.

**[58:42]** right here. I thought I had six minutes. Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. I

**[58:44]** Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. I

**[58:44]** Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. I apologize for our network issues. Um

**[58:46]** apologize for our network issues. Um

**[58:46]** apologize for our network issues. Um again, um let me put the um uh the one

**[58:50]** again, um let me put the um uh the one

**[58:50]** again, um let me put the um uh the one slide um back up

**[58:55]** slide um back up

**[58:55]** slide um back up there. Um you can go ahead and check out

**[58:57]** there. Um you can go ahead and check out

**[58:57]** there. Um you can go ahead and check out the uh the lab from there. Thank you.


### [59:00 - 01:00:00]

**[59:01]** the uh the lab from there. Thank you.

**[59:01]** the uh the lab from there. Thank you. [Music]
