**[00:37]** my name's Arman. I'm one of the co-founders and managing partners at a

**[00:38]** co-founders and managing partners at a

**[00:38]** co-founders and managing partners at a company called 10X. Uh my co-founder is

**[00:40]** company called 10X. Uh my co-founder is

**[00:40]** company called 10X. Uh my co-founder is Alex who's been uh kindly announcing

**[00:43]** Alex who's been uh kindly announcing

**[00:43]** Alex who's been uh kindly announcing everybody all day. We do a lot of cool

**[00:46]** everybody all day. We do a lot of cool

**[00:46]** everybody all day. We do a lot of cool work. We uh we help companies with their

**[00:48]** work. We uh we help companies with their

**[00:48]** work. We uh we help companies with their AI transformation. We have incredible

**[00:50]** AI transformation. We have incredible

**[00:50]** AI transformation. We have incredible clients all over the world. But I'm not

**[00:52]** clients all over the world. But I'm not

**[00:52]** clients all over the world. But I'm not going to talk about any of that today.

**[00:54]** going to talk about any of that today.

**[00:54]** going to talk about any of that today. I'm going to talk about something much

**[00:55]** I'm going to talk about something much

**[00:55]** I'm going to talk about something much more niche. I'm going to talk about how

**[00:57]** more niche. I'm going to talk about how

**[00:57]** more niche. I'm going to talk about how we pay engineers.

**[00:59]** we pay engineers.

**[00:59]** we pay engineers. And we pay engineers like salespeople.


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:03]** And we pay engineers like salespeople.

**[01:03]** And we pay engineers like salespeople. Earlier, I was just in the green room

**[01:04]** Earlier, I was just in the green room

**[01:04]** Earlier, I was just in the green room with a bunch of distinguished engineers

**[01:06]** with a bunch of distinguished engineers

**[01:06]** with a bunch of distinguished engineers that I've grown to uh respect for my

**[01:09]** that I've grown to uh respect for my

**[01:09]** that I've grown to uh respect for my entire career. And we were talking and I

**[01:12]** entire career. And we were talking and I

**[01:12]** entire career. And we were talking and I was telling them that we pay engineers

**[01:13]** was telling them that we pay engineers

**[01:13]** was telling them that we pay engineers based on the story points that they

**[01:15]** based on the story points that they

**[01:15]** based on the story points that they complete. And we had a lot of people

**[01:18]** complete. And we had a lot of people

**[01:18]** complete. And we had a lot of people roll their eyes and and laugh. And they

**[01:21]** roll their eyes and and laugh. And they

**[01:21]** roll their eyes and and laugh. And they asked, "What do you mean?" And I said,

**[01:22]** asked, "What do you mean?" And I said,

**[01:22]** asked, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Clients pay us for the number of story

**[01:24]** "Clients pay us for the number of story

**[01:24]** "Clients pay us for the number of story points that we deliver." and we pay

**[01:27]** points that we deliver." and we pay

**[01:27]** points that we deliver." and we pay engineers based on the number of story

**[01:28]** engineers based on the number of story

**[01:28]** engineers based on the number of story points that they complete. And similar

**[01:31]** points that they complete. And similar

**[01:31]** points that they complete. And similar to the looks that I'm getting from some

**[01:33]** to the looks that I'm getting from some

**[01:33]** to the looks that I'm getting from some of you, there was skepticism.

**[01:35]** of you, there was skepticism.

**[01:35]** of you, there was skepticism. And I know this sounds crazy, but it's

**[01:38]** And I know this sounds crazy, but it's

**[01:38]** And I know this sounds crazy, but it's working. We've been able to hire

**[01:40]** working. We've been able to hire

**[01:40]** working. We've been able to hire incredible engineers, many of whom have

**[01:42]** incredible engineers, many of whom have

**[01:42]** incredible engineers, many of whom have started and exited uh companies before

**[01:45]** started and exited uh companies before

**[01:45]** started and exited uh companies before this. We have been able to hire

**[01:47]** this. We have been able to hire

**[01:47]** this. We have been able to hire worldclass machine learning and AI

**[01:49]** worldclass machine learning and AI

**[01:49]** worldclass machine learning and AI researchers. We've hired rocket

**[01:51]** researchers. We've hired rocket

**[01:51]** researchers. We've hired rocket scientists from NASA. We are shipping

**[01:54]** scientists from NASA. We are shipping

**[01:54]** scientists from NASA. We are shipping code incredibly quickly and it's

**[01:56]** code incredibly quickly and it's

**[01:56]** code incredibly quickly and it's maintainable and high quality code. Of

**[01:59]** maintainable and high quality code. Of

**[01:59]** maintainable and high quality code. Of course, that is everyone's dream.


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** course, that is everyone's dream.

**[02:00]** course, that is everyone's dream. Everybody wants to hire great people.

**[02:02]** Everybody wants to hire great people.

**[02:02]** Everybody wants to hire great people. Everyone wants to deliver really uh fast

**[02:04]** Everyone wants to deliver really uh fast

**[02:04]** Everyone wants to deliver really uh fast code.

**[02:05]** code.

**[02:05]** code. So, my goal here is not to convince you

**[02:08]** So, my goal here is not to convince you

**[02:08]** So, my goal here is not to convince you all to adopt our model. My goal is to

**[02:10]** all to adopt our model. My goal is to

**[02:10]** all to adopt our model. My goal is to show you what compensation looks like in

**[02:13]** show you what compensation looks like in

**[02:13]** show you what compensation looks like in AI and hopefully provide a new

**[02:15]** AI and hopefully provide a new

**[02:15]** AI and hopefully provide a new perspective on the fact that things

**[02:17]** perspective on the fact that things

**[02:17]** perspective on the fact that things might change as we introduce this

**[02:18]** might change as we introduce this

**[02:18]** might change as we introduce this technology. Before I jump in though, I

**[02:21]** technology. Before I jump in though, I

**[02:21]** technology. Before I jump in though, I want to talk about uh how we got here.

**[02:24]** want to talk about uh how we got here.

**[02:24]** want to talk about uh how we got here. So, I'm a software engineer by training.

**[02:26]** So, I'm a software engineer by training.

**[02:26]** So, I'm a software engineer by training. I went to Carnegie Melon and then I

**[02:28]** I went to Carnegie Melon and then I

**[02:28]** I went to Carnegie Melon and then I taught there in their school of computer

**[02:29]** taught there in their school of computer

**[02:29]** taught there in their school of computer science. After that, I went to Google

**[02:31]** science. After that, I went to Google

**[02:31]** science. After that, I went to Google and I helped them scale their AI, cloud,

**[02:33]** and I helped them scale their AI, cloud,

**[02:33]** and I helped them scale their AI, cloud, and mobile practices internationally

**[02:35]** and mobile practices internationally

**[02:35]** and mobile practices internationally before starting a few venture-back

**[02:37]** before starting a few venture-back

**[02:37]** before starting a few venture-back startups. And in my last startup, I

**[02:39]** startups. And in my last startup, I

**[02:39]** startups. And in my last startup, I would work out of a Weiwork. And I was

**[02:41]** would work out of a Weiwork. And I was

**[02:41]** would work out of a Weiwork. And I was sitting in this uh 33 Irving Weiwork. If

**[02:43]** sitting in this uh 33 Irving Weiwork. If

**[02:43]** sitting in this uh 33 Irving Weiwork. If any of you are from New York, you you

**[02:44]** any of you are from New York, you you

**[02:44]** any of you are from New York, you you might have worked out of that Weiwork.

**[02:46]** might have worked out of that Weiwork.

**[02:46]** might have worked out of that Weiwork. And they have these big tables and there

**[02:47]** And they have these big tables and there

**[02:47]** And they have these big tables and there were 12 of 12 of us kind of sitting

**[02:49]** were 12 of 12 of us kind of sitting

**[02:49]** were 12 of 12 of us kind of sitting around. No one's talking. Everyone has

**[02:51]** around. No one's talking. Everyone has

**[02:51]** around. No one's talking. Everyone has their headphones in. And I look to my

**[02:53]** their headphones in. And I look to my

**[02:53]** their headphones in. And I look to my left and I see I see somebody with

**[02:55]** left and I see I see somebody with

**[02:55]** left and I see I see somebody with Visual Studio Code open, right? I'm

**[02:57]** Visual Studio Code open, right? I'm

**[02:57]** Visual Studio Code open, right? I'm like, "Okay, I have a fellow engineer to

**[02:59]** like, "Okay, I have a fellow engineer to

**[02:59]** like, "Okay, I have a fellow engineer to my left." And I see that he was typing,


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** my left." And I see that he was typing,

**[03:01]** my left." And I see that he was typing, but I didn't see a chat window. This

**[03:04]** but I didn't see a chat window. This

**[03:04]** but I didn't see a chat window. This person was typing into the code editor.

**[03:07]** person was typing into the code editor.

**[03:07]** person was typing into the code editor. They were typing fo

**[03:10]** They were typing fo

**[03:10]** They were typing fo [snorts] like a caveman. this this poor

**[03:12]** [snorts] like a caveman. this this poor

**[03:12]** [snorts] like a caveman. this this poor person was typing like with their little

**[03:14]** person was typing like with their little

**[03:14]** person was typing like with their little chopstick fingers individual characters.

**[03:17]** chopstick fingers individual characters.

**[03:17]** chopstick fingers individual characters. I I I couldn't believe it. On my

**[03:19]** I I I couldn't believe it. On my

**[03:19]** I I I couldn't believe it. On my computer, I had 45 agents. Three were

**[03:21]** computer, I had 45 agents. Three were

**[03:21]** computer, I had 45 agents. Three were ordering me lunch. Two were writing

**[03:23]** ordering me lunch. Two were writing

**[03:23]** ordering me lunch. Two were writing code. One was doing research. Just

**[03:25]** code. One was doing research. Just

**[03:25]** code. One was doing research. Just different worlds were happening on my

**[03:28]** different worlds were happening on my

**[03:28]** different worlds were happening on my computer versus this person's computer.

**[03:30]** computer versus this person's computer.

**[03:30]** computer versus this person's computer. And I felt bad. I thought maybe we

**[03:31]** And I felt bad. I thought maybe we

**[03:31]** And I felt bad. I thought maybe we should do a GoFundMe or something. But I

**[03:33]** should do a GoFundMe or something. But I

**[03:33]** should do a GoFundMe or something. But I I I tried to look deeply at what is

**[03:36]** I I tried to look deeply at what is

**[03:36]** I I tried to look deeply at what is actually causing this difference. Why am

**[03:39]** actually causing this difference. Why am

**[03:39]** actually causing this difference. Why am I using AI in the way that I am? And why

**[03:42]** I using AI in the way that I am? And why

**[03:42]** I using AI in the way that I am? And why is this person not?

**[03:44]** is this person not?

**[03:44]** is this person not? There are different ways that that

**[03:46]** There are different ways that that

**[03:46]** There are different ways that that people try AI and there are different

**[03:48]** people try AI and there are different

**[03:48]** people try AI and there are different reasons why people don't use it. We've

**[03:50]** reasons why people don't use it. We've

**[03:50]** reasons why people don't use it. We've all heard people who have tried it and

**[03:51]** all heard people who have tried it and

**[03:51]** all heard people who have tried it and have said it's not as good as me. We've

**[03:53]** have said it's not as good as me. We've

**[03:53]** have said it's not as good as me. We've all heard people who have not tried it

**[03:55]** all heard people who have not tried it

**[03:55]** all heard people who have not tried it because they don't want to. But

**[03:56]** because they don't want to. But

**[03:56]** because they don't want to. But regardless, my belief is that this is an

**[03:59]** regardless, my belief is that this is an

**[03:59]** regardless, my belief is that this is an incentive issue. For me, I was a founder


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:02]** incentive issue. For me, I was a founder

**[04:02]** incentive issue. For me, I was a founder and I wanted to squeak out every bit of

**[04:05]** and I wanted to squeak out every bit of

**[04:05]** and I wanted to squeak out every bit of incremental value and and efficiency

**[04:07]** incremental value and and efficiency

**[04:08]** incremental value and and efficiency that I could. And so I would sit on

**[04:10]** that I could. And so I would sit on

**[04:10]** that I could. And so I would sit on Twitter and LinkedIn and read blog posts

**[04:11]** Twitter and LinkedIn and read blog posts

**[04:11]** Twitter and LinkedIn and read blog posts and try to understand what is the

**[04:14]** and try to understand what is the

**[04:14]** and try to understand what is the cutting edge in software engineering and

**[04:16]** cutting edge in software engineering and

**[04:16]** cutting edge in software engineering and what's going to give me the ability to

**[04:18]** what's going to give me the ability to

**[04:18]** what's going to give me the ability to output more code, higher quality,

**[04:21]** output more code, higher quality,

**[04:21]** output more code, higher quality, faster. And because of that, I was using

**[04:24]** faster. And because of that, I was using

**[04:24]** faster. And because of that, I was using all these all these different agents.

**[04:26]** all these all these different agents.

**[04:26]** all these all these different agents. But this person probably worked at a

**[04:28]** But this person probably worked at a

**[04:28]** But this person probably worked at a startup, probably had a base salary with

**[04:31]** startup, probably had a base salary with

**[04:31]** startup, probably had a base salary with an annual bonus and some equity. And

**[04:34]** an annual bonus and some equity. And

**[04:34]** an annual bonus and some equity. And that was supposed to be the model that

**[04:35]** that was supposed to be the model that

**[04:36]** that was supposed to be the model that incentivized people to be innovated, to

**[04:38]** incentivized people to be innovated, to

**[04:38]** incentivized people to be innovated, to be innovative, and to work smarter and

**[04:40]** be innovative, and to work smarter and

**[04:40]** be innovative, and to work smarter and faster and harder. But it wasn't

**[04:42]** faster and harder. But it wasn't

**[04:42]** faster and harder. But it wasn't working. And so, in order to understand

**[04:45]** working. And so, in order to understand

**[04:45]** working. And so, in order to understand how we got to where we are, I'm going to

**[04:46]** how we got to where we are, I'm going to

**[04:46]** how we got to where we are, I'm going to do a brief uh history of compensation.

**[04:50]** do a brief uh history of compensation.

**[04:50]** do a brief uh history of compensation. And this is by no means accurate. I'm

**[04:53]** And this is by no means accurate. I'm

**[04:53]** And this is by no means accurate. I'm making a lot of things up here. It's all

**[04:55]** making a lot of things up here. It's all

**[04:55]** making a lot of things up here. It's all illustrative. Okay, so back in the day,

**[04:57]** illustrative. Okay, so back in the day,

**[04:58]** illustrative. Okay, so back in the day, we had some cavemen who were writing

**[04:59]** we had some cavemen who were writing

**[04:59]** we had some cavemen who were writing code. We were we were uh probably


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** code. We were we were uh probably

**[05:02]** code. We were we were uh probably inscribing C in a in a tablet somewhere

**[05:05]** inscribing C in a in a tablet somewhere

**[05:05]** inscribing C in a in a tablet somewhere and we were paying people hourly, right?

**[05:07]** and we were paying people hourly, right?

**[05:08]** and we were paying people hourly, right? This makes sense. I look at somebody

**[05:09]** This makes sense. I look at somebody

**[05:09]** This makes sense. I look at somebody sitting in a chair and I'm going to pay

**[05:11]** sitting in a chair and I'm going to pay

**[05:11]** sitting in a chair and I'm going to pay them some amount of dollars for some

**[05:13]** them some amount of dollars for some

**[05:13]** them some amount of dollars for some amount of time. That makes sense for me

**[05:15]** amount of time. That makes sense for me

**[05:15]** amount of time. That makes sense for me and it makes sense for the for the

**[05:16]** and it makes sense for the for the

**[05:16]** and it makes sense for the for the engineer. But why is that broken? I

**[05:18]** engineer. But why is that broken? I

**[05:18]** engineer. But why is that broken? I actually I want to hear from people. Why

**[05:19]** actually I want to hear from people. Why

**[05:20]** actually I want to hear from people. Why is hourly broken?

**[05:23]** is hourly broken?

**[05:23]** is hourly broken? >> Slow.

**[05:24]** >> Slow.

**[05:24]** >> Slow. It's slow output.

**[05:26]** It's slow output.

**[05:26]** It's slow output. >> No upside.

**[05:27]** >> No upside.

**[05:27]** >> No upside. >> There's no upside. There's no reason to

**[05:29]** >> There's no upside. There's no reason to

**[05:29]** >> There's no upside. There's no reason to work faster, right? And in fact, there's

**[05:31]** work faster, right? And in fact, there's

**[05:31]** work faster, right? And in fact, there's a disincentive to work faster. And so,

**[05:34]** a disincentive to work faster. And so,

**[05:34]** a disincentive to work faster. And so, what if I I notice this as the buyer of

**[05:36]** what if I I notice this as the buyer of

**[05:36]** what if I I notice this as the buyer of this technology and I say, "Okay, how

**[05:37]** this technology and I say, "Okay, how

**[05:37]** this technology and I say, "Okay, how long is it going to take you? It's going

**[05:38]** long is it going to take you? It's going

**[05:38]** long is it going to take you? It's going to take you five hours. Okay, so I'll

**[05:40]** to take you five hours. Okay, so I'll

**[05:40]** to take you five hours. Okay, so I'll pay you 500 bucks, right? Hourly $100.

**[05:43]** pay you 500 bucks, right? Hourly $100.

**[05:43]** pay you 500 bucks, right? Hourly $100. Multiply that by five." And then you as

**[05:45]** Multiply that by five." And then you as

**[05:45]** Multiply that by five." And then you as the engineer, if you work faster, great.

**[05:47]** the engineer, if you work faster, great.

**[05:47]** the engineer, if you work faster, great. You get to keep the $500. And if you

**[05:49]** You get to keep the $500. And if you

**[05:49]** You get to keep the $500. And if you work slower, that's on you. As

**[05:52]** work slower, that's on you. As

**[05:52]** work slower, that's on you. As engineers, we're really, really bad at

**[05:53]** engineers, we're really, really bad at

**[05:53]** engineers, we're really, really bad at estimating how long things are going to

**[05:55]** estimating how long things are going to

**[05:55]** estimating how long things are going to take. And so because of that, I'm not

**[05:57]** take. And so because of that, I'm not

**[05:57]** take. And so because of that, I'm not going to say it's going to take five

**[05:58]** going to say it's going to take five

**[05:58]** going to say it's going to take five hours. I'm going to say it's going to

**[05:59]** hours. I'm going to say it's going to

**[05:59]** hours. I'm going to say it's going to take 15 hours, 20 hours, so that I have


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:02]** take 15 hours, 20 hours, so that I have

**[06:02]** take 15 hours, 20 hours, so that I have no downside. And so again, as the buyer,

**[06:04]** no downside. And so again, as the buyer,

**[06:04]** no downside. And so again, as the buyer, I don't want to pay you based on the

**[06:07]** I don't want to pay you based on the

**[06:07]** I don't want to pay you based on the project.

**[06:08]** project.

**[06:08]** project. So what if we hire people on salary and

**[06:10]** So what if we hire people on salary and

**[06:10]** So what if we hire people on salary and give them a bonus, right? Well, we in

**[06:13]** give them a bonus, right? Well, we in

**[06:13]** give them a bonus, right? Well, we in the startup community know what happens

**[06:14]** the startup community know what happens

**[06:14]** the startup community know what happens in that when when this is the case.

**[06:17]** in that when when this is the case.

**[06:17]** in that when when this is the case. People punch in at five, leave or nine,

**[06:19]** People punch in at five, leave or nine,

**[06:19]** People punch in at five, leave or nine, leave at five. And so I'm Larry Paige. I

**[06:23]** leave at five. And so I'm Larry Paige. I

**[06:23]** leave at five. And so I'm Larry Paige. I noticed this and I see why am I working

**[06:24]** noticed this and I see why am I working

**[06:24]** noticed this and I see why am I working so hard at Google? Why am I putting my

**[06:27]** so hard at Google? Why am I putting my

**[06:27]** so hard at Google? Why am I putting my blood, sweat, and tears into this? It's

**[06:28]** blood, sweat, and tears into this? It's

**[06:28]** blood, sweat, and tears into this? It's because I have some of the upside. I own

**[06:31]** because I have some of the upside. I own

**[06:31]** because I have some of the upside. I own the company, right? And so when we exit

**[06:33]** the company, right? And so when we exit

**[06:33]** the company, right? And so when we exit for for many, many dollars, I'm going to

**[06:35]** for for many, many dollars, I'm going to

**[06:35]** for for many, many dollars, I'm going to see that. So what if I can share that

**[06:37]** see that. So what if I can share that

**[06:37]** see that. So what if I can share that with my employees? And that's when

**[06:39]** with my employees? And that's when

**[06:39]** with my employees? And that's when equity comes in. And and this has

**[06:41]** equity comes in. And and this has

**[06:41]** equity comes in. And and this has worked. This has worked for many many

**[06:43]** worked. This has worked for many many

**[06:43]** worked. This has worked for many many years to incentivize employees. This is

**[06:46]** years to incentivize employees. This is

**[06:46]** years to incentivize employees. This is this is the foundation of the startup

**[06:48]** this is the foundation of the startup

**[06:48]** this is the foundation of the startup community that we all know and are a

**[06:49]** community that we all know and are a

**[06:49]** community that we all know and are a part of. It's incredible.

**[06:52]** part of. It's incredible.

**[06:52]** part of. It's incredible. But

**[06:53]** But

**[06:53]** But the not every company is Google. In

**[06:56]** the not every company is Google. In

**[06:56]** the not every company is Google. In fact, for every one Google, there are

**[06:58]** fact, for every one Google, there are

**[06:58]** fact, for every one Google, there are many many failures. And software

**[06:59]** many many failures. And software


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** many many failures. And software engineers know this, right? For those

**[07:02]** engineers know this, right? For those

**[07:02]** engineers know this, right? For those who want to take the risk, many will

**[07:04]** who want to take the risk, many will

**[07:04]** who want to take the risk, many will just go to YC or or start their own

**[07:06]** just go to YC or or start their own

**[07:06]** just go to YC or or start their own company. And for the ones who don't want

**[07:08]** company. And for the ones who don't want

**[07:08]** company. And for the ones who don't want the risk, they're opting for cash over

**[07:10]** the risk, they're opting for cash over

**[07:10]** the risk, they're opting for cash over equity. Many of us who've hired

**[07:12]** equity. Many of us who've hired

**[07:12]** equity. Many of us who've hired engineers know that the cash is

**[07:15]** engineers know that the cash is

**[07:15]** engineers know that the cash is non-negotiable equity. Yeah, sure. I'll

**[07:17]** non-negotiable equity. Yeah, sure. I'll

**[07:17]** non-negotiable equity. Yeah, sure. I'll take some upside.

**[07:20]** take some upside.

**[07:20]** take some upside. And so my contention is that this model

**[07:22]** And so my contention is that this model

**[07:22]** And so my contention is that this model needs to be reinvented in the age of AI.

**[07:25]** needs to be reinvented in the age of AI.

**[07:25]** needs to be reinvented in the age of AI. We need to directly incentivize people

**[07:27]** We need to directly incentivize people

**[07:28]** We need to directly incentivize people to use these tools and to use them well

**[07:30]** to use these tools and to use them well

**[07:30]** to use these tools and to use them well and to still maintain really high

**[07:33]** and to still maintain really high

**[07:33]** and to still maintain really high quality standards of code. And so here's

**[07:36]** quality standards of code. And so here's

**[07:36]** quality standards of code. And so here's how it works for us. So we basically

**[07:38]** how it works for us. So we basically

**[07:38]** how it works for us. So we basically just to take a step back, we do two

**[07:39]** just to take a step back, we do two

**[07:39]** just to take a step back, we do two types of work at 10X. One is road

**[07:41]** types of work at 10X. One is road

**[07:41]** types of work at 10X. One is road mapping and one is execution. So

**[07:44]** mapping and one is execution. So

**[07:44]** mapping and one is execution. So companies come to us and they say hey we

**[07:46]** companies come to us and they say hey we

**[07:46]** companies come to us and they say hey we want AI. That's generally the request.

**[07:49]** want AI. That's generally the request.

**[07:49]** want AI. That's generally the request. Sometimes it's more specific. It's like

**[07:51]** Sometimes it's more specific. It's like

**[07:51]** Sometimes it's more specific. It's like hey I want my customer service team to

**[07:54]** hey I want my customer service team to

**[07:54]** hey I want my customer service team to have 10% more uh output using AI, right?

**[07:57]** have 10% more uh output using AI, right?

**[07:57]** have 10% more uh output using AI, right? But but generally they come to us with a

**[07:58]** But but generally they come to us with a

**[07:58]** But but generally they come to us with a request. We do a bunch of studying and


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** request. We do a bunch of studying and

**[08:00]** request. We do a bunch of studying and learning and then we output a road map

**[08:03]** learning and then we output a road map

**[08:03]** learning and then we output a road map and based on that road map they can take

**[08:05]** and based on that road map they can take

**[08:06]** and based on that road map they can take it and work on it on their own or we can

**[08:08]** it and work on it on their own or we can

**[08:08]** it and work on it on their own or we can do it. For a lot of things, we're taking

**[08:10]** do it. For a lot of things, we're taking

**[08:10]** do it. For a lot of things, we're taking off-the-shelf tools, but a lot of what

**[08:12]** off-the-shelf tools, but a lot of what

**[08:12]** off-the-shelf tools, but a lot of what we do is custom builds, and that's where

**[08:14]** we do is custom builds, and that's where

**[08:14]** we do is custom builds, and that's where the story point model comes in. So, we

**[08:17]** the story point model comes in. So, we

**[08:17]** the story point model comes in. So, we will build a roadmap for a lot of our

**[08:18]** will build a roadmap for a lot of our

**[08:18]** will build a roadmap for a lot of our clients, but once they see that, then

**[08:20]** clients, but once they see that, then

**[08:20]** clients, but once they see that, then they're putting in requests on their own

**[08:22]** they're putting in requests on their own

**[08:22]** they're putting in requests on their own as well. And we have two roles in the

**[08:24]** as well. And we have two roles in the

**[08:24]** as well. And we have two roles in the company that are client facing. One is

**[08:25]** company that are client facing. One is

**[08:25]** company that are client facing. One is the strategist and the other is the AI

**[08:27]** the strategist and the other is the AI

**[08:27]** the strategist and the other is the AI engineer. The strategists are all are

**[08:31]** engineer. The strategists are all are

**[08:31]** engineer. The strategists are all are mostly technical. And so, we've have we

**[08:33]** mostly technical. And so, we've have we

**[08:33]** mostly technical. And so, we've have we have former PMs, we have former

**[08:35]** have former PMs, we have former

**[08:35]** have former PMs, we have former engineers. They are doing PM type work,

**[08:38]** engineers. They are doing PM type work,

**[08:38]** engineers. They are doing PM type work, consulting type work. They're the ones

**[08:39]** consulting type work. They're the ones

**[08:39]** consulting type work. They're the ones that are taking the product requirements

**[08:42]** that are taking the product requirements

**[08:42]** that are taking the product requirements and distilling that down with the

**[08:44]** and distilling that down with the

**[08:44]** and distilling that down with the client. Then they hand that over to the

**[08:46]** client. Then they hand that over to the

**[08:46]** client. Then they hand that over to the engineer and the engineer puts together

**[08:48]** engineer and the engineer puts together

**[08:48]** engineer and the engineer puts together an architecture design document. They

**[08:50]** an architecture design document. They

**[08:50]** an architecture design document. They spend a lot of time doing that. In fact,

**[08:52]** spend a lot of time doing that. In fact,

**[08:52]** spend a lot of time doing that. In fact, that is where most of our engineering

**[08:55]** that is where most of our engineering

**[08:55]** that is where most of our engineering time goes. Then they write code and they

**[08:59]** time goes. Then they write code and they

**[08:59]** time goes. Then they write code and they start implementing that that


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:01]** start implementing that that

**[09:01]** start implementing that that architecture design document includes

**[09:02]** architecture design document includes

**[09:02]** architecture design document includes tickets and each ticket is graded on

**[09:05]** tickets and each ticket is graded on

**[09:05]** tickets and each ticket is graded on some number of story points. This is a

**[09:06]** some number of story points. This is a

**[09:06]** some number of story points. This is a very traditional method of doing work,

**[09:08]** very traditional method of doing work,

**[09:08]** very traditional method of doing work, right?

**[09:10]** right?

**[09:10]** right? And when that ticket is accepted, the

**[09:13]** And when that ticket is accepted, the

**[09:13]** And when that ticket is accepted, the engineer gets paid a a fee per story

**[09:15]** engineer gets paid a a fee per story

**[09:15]** engineer gets paid a a fee per story point that they complete. Our engineers

**[09:17]** point that they complete. Our engineers

**[09:17]** point that they complete. Our engineers have a flat base that they're paid and

**[09:19]** have a flat base that they're paid and

**[09:19]** have a flat base that they're paid and then every quarter we round up based on

**[09:21]** then every quarter we round up based on

**[09:21]** then every quarter we round up based on the story points that they've completed.

**[09:22]** the story points that they've completed.

**[09:22]** the story points that they've completed. And again, this has led to us being able

**[09:24]** And again, this has led to us being able

**[09:24]** And again, this has led to us being able to hire incredible people, but we've

**[09:26]** to hire incredible people, but we've

**[09:26]** to hire incredible people, but we've also been able to do incredible work.

**[09:28]** also been able to do incredible work.

**[09:28]** also been able to do incredible work. So, I'm going to walk through a couple

**[09:29]** So, I'm going to walk through a couple

**[09:29]** So, I'm going to walk through a couple of projects that we've done. So, this is

**[09:31]** of projects that we've done. So, this is

**[09:31]** of projects that we've done. So, this is one. This is a billboard company.

**[09:34]** one. This is a billboard company.

**[09:34]** one. This is a billboard company. If you go to Times Square right now,

**[09:35]** If you go to Times Square right now,

**[09:35]** If you go to Times Square right now, you'll see some billboards that they've

**[09:37]** you'll see some billboards that they've

**[09:37]** you'll see some billboards that they've sold that inventory for.

**[09:39]** sold that inventory for.

**[09:39]** sold that inventory for. They sell in two ways. One is you can

**[09:41]** They sell in two ways. One is you can

**[09:41]** They sell in two ways. One is you can call them up traditional sales you can

**[09:43]** call them up traditional sales you can

**[09:43]** call them up traditional sales you can buy that inventory but the other is they

**[09:45]** buy that inventory but the other is they

**[09:45]** buy that inventory but the other is they have like an Uber for billboards type of

**[09:47]** have like an Uber for billboards type of

**[09:47]** have like an Uber for billboards type of product where you can go online you can

**[09:49]** product where you can go online you can

**[09:49]** product where you can go online you can upload a PNG you can choose where you

**[09:51]** upload a PNG you can choose where you

**[09:51]** upload a PNG you can choose where you want this to run and for how long

**[09:53]** want this to run and for how long

**[09:53]** want this to run and for how long similar to like a Facebook or Google ad

**[09:56]** similar to like a Facebook or Google ad

**[09:56]** similar to like a Facebook or Google ad it's very similar to that experience and

**[09:58]** it's very similar to that experience and

**[09:58]** it's very similar to that experience and they came to us and they said hey we

**[09:59]** they came to us and they said hey we


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** they came to us and they said hey we think that there's some opportunities

**[10:00]** think that there's some opportunities

**[10:00]** think that there's some opportunities for AI in our product we did an analysis

**[10:03]** for AI in our product we did an analysis

**[10:03]** for AI in our product we did an analysis and we found a few one of them is this

**[10:06]** and we found a few one of them is this

**[10:06]** and we found a few one of them is this we found that when an image is uploaded

**[10:07]** we found that when an image is uploaded

**[10:07]** we found that when an image is uploaded to their system it has to go through two

**[10:09]** to their system it has to go through two

**[10:10]** to their system it has to go through two rounds

**[10:10]** rounds

**[10:10]** rounds of moderation. One is internal to the

**[10:12]** of moderation. One is internal to the

**[10:12]** of moderation. One is internal to the company and the other is with the

**[10:14]** company and the other is with the

**[10:14]** company and the other is with the billboard owner internal to their

**[10:17]** billboard owner internal to their

**[10:17]** billboard owner internal to their company. They're spending money on that

**[10:19]** company. They're spending money on that

**[10:19]** company. They're spending money on that to actually hire the people to do that

**[10:21]** to actually hire the people to do that

**[10:21]** to actually hire the people to do that and there's a lot of inaccuracy

**[10:24]** and there's a lot of inaccuracy

**[10:24]** and there's a lot of inaccuracy and it takes a lot of time. So that

**[10:26]** and it takes a lot of time. So that

**[10:26]** and it takes a lot of time. So that costs them money and it costs them

**[10:28]** costs them money and it costs them

**[10:28]** costs them money and it costs them revenue because every moment that the

**[10:30]** revenue because every moment that the

**[10:30]** revenue because every moment that the billboard is not running, they're not

**[10:32]** billboard is not running, they're not

**[10:32]** billboard is not running, they're not making money. And so we found what if we

**[10:34]** making money. And so we found what if we

**[10:34]** making money. And so we found what if we could build an AI model that can

**[10:36]** could build an AI model that can

**[10:36]** could build an AI model that can actually do this moderation for them. We

**[10:38]** actually do this moderation for them. We

**[10:38]** actually do this moderation for them. We scoped that out. We built the

**[10:40]** scoped that out. We built the

**[10:40]** scoped that out. We built the architecture uh design doc. We broke it

**[10:42]** architecture uh design doc. We broke it

**[10:42]** architecture uh design doc. We broke it down into tickets and we built this for

**[10:43]** down into tickets and we built this for

**[10:43]** down into tickets and we built this for them. We did it in two weeks and we got

**[10:45]** them. We did it in two weeks and we got

**[10:45]** them. We did it in two weeks and we got to 96% accuracy when compared to the

**[10:47]** to 96% accuracy when compared to the

**[10:47]** to 96% accuracy when compared to the human moderator. We've done a lot of

**[10:49]** human moderator. We've done a lot of

**[10:49]** human moderator. We've done a lot of other projects with this company as

**[10:50]** other projects with this company as

**[10:50]** other projects with this company as well. This is another company. This is

**[10:53]** well. This is another company. This is

**[10:53]** well. This is another company. This is they work with retailers all around the

**[10:55]** they work with retailers all around the

**[10:55]** they work with retailers all around the world and currently they have devices in

**[10:58]** world and currently they have devices in

**[10:58]** world and currently they have devices in these retailers and they're low power


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** these retailers and they're low power

**[11:00]** these retailers and they're low power devices. And so because of this they're

**[11:02]** devices. And so because of this they're

**[11:02]** devices. And so because of this they're able to run one AI model on device and

**[11:05]** able to run one AI model on device and

**[11:06]** able to run one AI model on device and what this model does is does heat

**[11:07]** what this model does is does heat

**[11:07]** what this model does is does heat mapping. So imagine there's a camera in

**[11:08]** mapping. So imagine there's a camera in

**[11:08]** mapping. So imagine there's a camera in this room looks down and it can

**[11:10]** this room looks down and it can

**[11:10]** this room looks down and it can basically generate a heat map of where

**[11:12]** basically generate a heat map of where

**[11:12]** basically generate a heat map of where the traffic is throughout the day. And

**[11:14]** the traffic is throughout the day. And

**[11:14]** the traffic is throughout the day. And for retailers, of course, this is very,

**[11:15]** for retailers, of course, this is very,

**[11:15]** for retailers, of course, this is very, very useful. But there's other things

**[11:17]** very useful. But there's other things

**[11:18]** very useful. But there's other things you can do too, right? If we just sit

**[11:20]** you can do too, right? If we just sit

**[11:20]** you can do too, right? If we just sit here for a few minutes, we can probably

**[11:21]** here for a few minutes, we can probably

**[11:21]** here for a few minutes, we can probably come up with a lot of ideas of if you

**[11:23]** come up with a lot of ideas of if you

**[11:23]** come up with a lot of ideas of if you have a camera with a chip, you can make

**[11:25]** have a camera with a chip, you can make

**[11:25]** have a camera with a chip, you can make a lot of money from that. You can show

**[11:27]** a lot of money from that. You can show

**[11:27]** a lot of money from that. You can show really useful information. And so that's

**[11:29]** really useful information. And so that's

**[11:29]** really useful information. And so that's what we did. We we came up with what are

**[11:31]** what we did. We we came up with what are

**[11:31]** what we did. We we came up with what are some of the things that we could do with

**[11:33]** some of the things that we could do with

**[11:33]** some of the things that we could do with this? if you put a little bit little bit

**[11:35]** this? if you put a little bit little bit

**[11:35]** this? if you put a little bit little bit more power in that ship, if you make the

**[11:37]** more power in that ship, if you make the

**[11:37]** more power in that ship, if you make the models, if you quantize them so they can

**[11:39]** models, if you quantize them so they can

**[11:39]** models, if you quantize them so they can run in parallel, what could you do? And

**[11:42]** run in parallel, what could you do? And

**[11:42]** run in parallel, what could you do? And so we gave them this report and then we

**[11:44]** so we gave them this report and then we

**[11:44]** so we gave them this report and then we built them five models that can run in

**[11:45]** built them five models that can run in

**[11:45]** built them five models that can run in parallel. It does everything from heat

**[11:47]** parallel. It does everything from heat

**[11:47]** parallel. It does everything from heat mapping to Q detection to theft

**[11:48]** mapping to Q detection to theft

**[11:48]** mapping to Q detection to theft detection and more. And again, we start

**[11:51]** detection and more. And again, we start

**[11:51]** detection and more. And again, we start with the product requirement stock. We

**[11:53]** with the product requirement stock. We

**[11:53]** with the product requirement stock. We break this down into architecture. Then

**[11:54]** break this down into architecture. Then

**[11:54]** break this down into architecture. Then we build it and then we pay engineers

**[11:56]** we build it and then we pay engineers

**[11:56]** we build it and then we pay engineers based on the output.


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:02]** This is the big question. What are the

**[12:02]** This is the big question. What are the risks? Right? Right? I just talked about

**[12:04]** risks? Right? Right? I just talked about

**[12:04]** risks? Right? Right? I just talked about dandelions and rainbows, right? Uh so I

**[12:07]** dandelions and rainbows, right? Uh so I

**[12:08]** dandelions and rainbows, right? Uh so I promised you that my goal is not to

**[12:09]** promised you that my goal is not to

**[12:09]** promised you that my goal is not to convince you to do this. And part of

**[12:11]** convince you to do this. And part of

**[12:11]** convince you to do this. And part of this is showing you what the potential

**[12:13]** this is showing you what the potential

**[12:13]** this is showing you what the potential risks are. These are a few that come up.

**[12:15]** risks are. These are a few that come up.

**[12:16]** risks are. These are a few that come up. One is what if an engineer inflates the

**[12:19]** One is what if an engineer inflates the

**[12:19]** One is what if an engineer inflates the story points, right? What if an engineer

**[12:21]** story points, right? What if an engineer

**[12:21]** story points, right? What if an engineer says, "Okay, you want me to add a

**[12:22]** says, "Okay, you want me to add a

**[12:22]** says, "Okay, you want me to add a button? 45 story points." Right?

**[12:26]** button? 45 story points." Right?

**[12:26]** button? 45 story points." Right? What if an engineer rushes and quality

**[12:28]** What if an engineer rushes and quality

**[12:28]** What if an engineer rushes and quality drops? You're saying that it took two

**[12:30]** drops? You're saying that it took two

**[12:30]** drops? You're saying that it took two weeks to do that. Well, was it good? Did

**[12:32]** weeks to do that. Well, was it good? Did

**[12:32]** weeks to do that. Well, was it good? Did it work?

**[12:35]** it work?

**[12:35]** it work? And what if engineers get sharp elbowed?

**[12:37]** And what if engineers get sharp elbowed?

**[12:38]** And what if engineers get sharp elbowed? I started this by saying that we

**[12:39]** I started this by saying that we

**[12:39]** I started this by saying that we compensate engineers like salespeople.

**[12:42]** compensate engineers like salespeople.

**[12:42]** compensate engineers like salespeople. It's not a it's not a culture that we
