### [00:00 - 01:00]

**[00:17]** Okay. So, my name is Itar Friedman, CEO

**[00:17]** Okay. So, my name is Itar Friedman, CEO and co-founder of Codto and I'm going to

**[00:19]** and co-founder of Codto and I'm going to

**[00:19]** and co-founder of Codto and I'm going to talk about yeah vibe coding but more on

**[00:21]** talk about yeah vibe coding but more on

**[00:21]** talk about yeah vibe coding but more on the confidence part and why this is

**[00:24]** the confidence part and why this is

**[00:24]** the confidence part and why this is maybe surprising why CLI might be the

**[00:27]** maybe surprising why CLI might be the

**[00:27]** maybe surprising why CLI might be the new interface leader for that. uh and uh

**[00:30]** new interface leader for that. uh and uh

**[00:30]** new interface leader for that. uh and uh we are soft launching a CLI tool uh

**[00:33]** we are soft launching a CLI tool uh

**[00:33]** we are soft launching a CLI tool uh right now five minutes ago. So you can

**[00:35]** right now five minutes ago. So you can

**[00:35]** right now five minutes ago. So you can go so you can go and install it uh soft

**[00:38]** go so you can go and install it uh soft

**[00:38]** go so you can go and install it uh soft launch play with it give us feedback uh

**[00:40]** launch play with it give us feedback uh

**[00:40]** launch play with it give us feedback uh there is some capacity and uh in order

**[00:43]** there is some capacity and uh in order

**[00:43]** there is some capacity and uh in order to verify like who is in the audience

**[00:45]** to verify like who is in the audience

**[00:45]** to verify like who is in the audience just like if you can tell me if you

**[00:46]** just like if you can tell me if you

**[00:46]** just like if you can tell me if you tried cloud code or codci

**[00:50]** tried cloud code or codci

**[00:50]** tried cloud code or codci okay and I guess if I ask about aides

**[00:53]** okay and I guess if I ask about aides

**[00:53]** okay and I guess if I ask about aides you would also also do that right and

**[00:55]** you would also also do that right and

**[00:55]** you would also also do that right and the question is why and I'm going to

**[00:57]** the question is why and I'm going to

**[00:57]** the question is why and I'm going to talk about it a bit okay


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** talk about it a bit okay

**[01:00]** talk about it a bit okay uh so the agenda is that I'm actually

**[01:02]** uh so the agenda is that I'm actually

**[01:02]** uh so the agenda is that I'm actually going to do really zoom out to the gen

**[01:05]** going to do really zoom out to the gen

**[01:05]** going to do really zoom out to the gen 3.0. What do I mean by that? And from

**[01:07]** 3.0. What do I mean by that? And from

**[01:07]** 3.0. What do I mean by that? And from the autocomplete to the multi- aent

**[01:09]** the autocomplete to the multi- aent

**[01:09]** the autocomplete to the multi- aent workflow and workflows, you see it's a

**[01:12]** workflow and workflows, you see it's a

**[01:12]** workflow and workflows, you see it's a theme that we're returning here CLI is

**[01:14]** theme that we're returning here CLI is

**[01:14]** theme that we're returning here CLI is something that can support that. Uh and

**[01:17]** something that can support that. Uh and

**[01:17]** something that can support that. Uh and how do we believe at Kodto is going to

**[01:19]** how do we believe at Kodto is going to

**[01:19]** how do we believe at Kodto is going to be the real shift in software

**[01:20]** be the real shift in software

**[01:20]** be the real shift in software development and uh like why is the CLI

**[01:24]** development and uh like why is the CLI

**[01:24]** development and uh like why is the CLI is the future in you know being able to

**[01:26]** is the future in you know being able to

**[01:26]** is the future in you know being able to do vibe coding with confidence and

**[01:28]** do vibe coding with confidence and

**[01:28]** do vibe coding with confidence and eventually I'm going to connect do zoom

**[01:30]** eventually I'm going to connect do zoom

**[01:30]** eventually I'm going to connect do zoom out again. And I'm going to zoom in zoom

**[01:31]** out again. And I'm going to zoom in zoom

**[01:31]** out again. And I'm going to zoom in zoom out even with a demo uh and connect the

**[01:33]** out even with a demo uh and connect the

**[01:34]** out even with a demo uh and connect the dots and I will uh say what explain a

**[01:36]** dots and I will uh say what explain a

**[01:36]** dots and I will uh say what explain a bit what is cod. I didn't do it right

**[01:38]** bit what is cod. I didn't do it right

**[01:38]** bit what is cod. I didn't do it right now and we'll do it a bit a bit later

**[01:40]** now and we'll do it a bit a bit later

**[01:40]** now and we'll do it a bit a bit later but that's something I'm going to cover

**[01:42]** but that's something I'm going to cover

**[01:42]** but that's something I'm going to cover shortly. So AI for developers and I just

**[01:46]** shortly. So AI for developers and I just

**[01:46]** shortly. So AI for developers and I just think that most of people here are

**[01:48]** think that most of people here are

**[01:48]** think that most of people here are developers according to the amount of

**[01:50]** developers according to the amount of

**[01:50]** developers according to the amount of hands that were raised. So I think like

**[01:52]** hands that were raised. So I think like

**[01:52]** hands that were raised. So I think like we first got some tools that we liked AI

**[01:55]** we first got some tools that we liked AI

**[01:55]** we first got some tools that we liked AI tools then we got some tools that we

**[01:56]** tools then we got some tools that we

**[01:56]** tools then we got some tools that we loved and I'm not that sure that we

**[01:59]** loved and I'm not that sure that we

**[01:59]** loved and I'm not that sure that we actually uh get tools into our hands


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:02]** actually uh get tools into our hands

**[02:02]** actually uh get tools into our hands that completely u be become a gamecher

**[02:06]** that completely u be become a gamecher

**[02:06]** that completely u be become a gamecher for us. Okay, my it's maybe unpopular

**[02:09]** for us. Okay, my it's maybe unpopular

**[02:09]** for us. Okay, my it's maybe unpopular opinion. I'm going to elaborate a bit.

**[02:10]** opinion. I'm going to elaborate a bit.

**[02:10]** opinion. I'm going to elaborate a bit. So, in order to do that, I'm going to

**[02:12]** So, in order to do that, I'm going to

**[02:12]** So, in order to do that, I'm going to differentiate developers between noobs

**[02:14]** differentiate developers between noobs

**[02:14]** differentiate developers between noobs and enterprise. It's a bit weird like

**[02:16]** and enterprise. It's a bit weird like

**[02:16]** and enterprise. It's a bit weird like it's not necessarily juniors like they

**[02:18]** it's not necessarily juniors like they

**[02:18]** it's not necessarily juniors like they are juniors in enterprise, right? But

**[02:20]** are juniors in enterprise, right? But

**[02:20]** are juniors in enterprise, right? But still, you know, like let's let's use

**[02:23]** still, you know, like let's let's use

**[02:23]** still, you know, like let's let's use that for for a second. Noobs versus

**[02:25]** that for for a second. Noobs versus

**[02:25]** that for for a second. Noobs versus enterprise. So, I think Gen 1.0 uh was

**[02:28]** enterprise. So, I think Gen 1.0 uh was

**[02:28]** enterprise. So, I think Gen 1.0 uh was the autocomplete moment, right? We

**[02:30]** the autocomplete moment, right? We

**[02:30]** the autocomplete moment, right? We started being able to generate uh

**[02:32]** started being able to generate uh

**[02:32]** started being able to generate uh writing our our our code and getting a

**[02:35]** writing our our our code and getting a

**[02:35]** writing our our our code and getting a few lines ahead of us. We really like

**[02:36]** few lines ahead of us. We really like

**[02:36]** few lines ahead of us. We really like that if you weren't a developer like you

**[02:39]** that if you weren't a developer like you

**[02:39]** that if you weren't a developer like you couldn't really do more right so you

**[02:41]** couldn't really do more right so you

**[02:41]** couldn't really do more right so you needed to be a developer already and

**[02:43]** needed to be a developer already and

**[02:43]** needed to be a developer already and then came uh the gen 2.0 Oh, the chat,

**[02:46]** then came uh the gen 2.0 Oh, the chat,

**[02:46]** then came uh the gen 2.0 Oh, the chat, diagentic chat. And I think like we saw

**[02:48]** diagentic chat. And I think like we saw

**[02:48]** diagentic chat. And I think like we saw even junior developers generating much

**[02:50]** even junior developers generating much

**[02:50]** even junior developers generating much more lines of code. Uh maybe the seniors

**[02:53]** more lines of code. Uh maybe the seniors

**[02:53]** more lines of code. Uh maybe the seniors or the enterprise liked it but also had

**[02:55]** or the enterprise liked it but also had

**[02:55]** or the enterprise liked it but also had a lot of problems with it. They need to

**[02:57]** a lot of problems with it. They need to

**[02:57]** a lot of problems with it. They need to review much more code, not necessarily

**[02:59]** review much more code, not necessarily

**[02:59]** review much more code, not necessarily high quality code. I hear that a lot and


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** high quality code. I hear that a lot and

**[03:02]** high quality code. I hear that a lot and I'm going to show you like uh 500 tweets

**[03:04]** I'm going to show you like uh 500 tweets

**[03:04]** I'm going to show you like uh 500 tweets uh about it. Not really, but but from

**[03:06]** uh about it. Not really, but but from

**[03:06]** uh about it. Not really, but but from some opinion leaders. And I think that

**[03:09]** some opinion leaders. And I think that

**[03:09]** some opinion leaders. And I think that the game changer moment is when we will

**[03:11]** the game changer moment is when we will

**[03:12]** the game changer moment is when we will move from chatic chat to actually being

**[03:15]** move from chatic chat to actually being

**[03:15]** move from chatic chat to actually being able to uh and it's a spoiler command

**[03:17]** able to uh and it's a spoiler command

**[03:18]** able to uh and it's a spoiler command command line interface to give commands

**[03:20]** command line interface to give commands

**[03:20]** command line interface to give commands to to our agents as if they're like team

**[03:24]** to to our agents as if they're like team

**[03:24]** to to our agents as if they're like team members and they do end toend flow. What

**[03:26]** members and they do end toend flow. What

**[03:26]** members and they do end toend flow. What is an end toend flow is something I'm

**[03:27]** is an end toend flow is something I'm

**[03:27]** is an end toend flow is something I'm going to talk about a bit. Uh and I

**[03:29]** going to talk about a bit. Uh and I

**[03:29]** going to talk about a bit. Uh and I think like you will see different

**[03:31]** think like you will see different

**[03:31]** think like you will see different players and in different parts of of

**[03:33]** players and in different parts of of

**[03:33]** players and in different parts of of this map like I mean different tools.

**[03:35]** this map like I mean different tools.

**[03:35]** this map like I mean different tools. Let's let's think about it again. So I

**[03:37]** Let's let's think about it again. So I

**[03:37]** Let's let's think about it again. So I think like in the in the autocomplete

**[03:39]** think like in the in the autocomplete

**[03:39]** think like in the in the autocomplete moment, we saw first ID plugins. Again,

**[03:41]** moment, we saw first ID plugins. Again,

**[03:41]** moment, we saw first ID plugins. Again, it's not a game changer. I'm just like

**[03:43]** it's not a game changer. I'm just like

**[03:43]** it's not a game changer. I'm just like going to complete more lines of code uh

**[03:45]** going to complete more lines of code uh

**[03:45]** going to complete more lines of code uh uh for you. Uh we liked it. And then uh

**[03:47]** uh for you. Uh we liked it. And then uh

**[03:48]** uh for you. Uh we liked it. And then uh let's rethink how we do coding inside

**[03:51]** let's rethink how we do coding inside

**[03:51]** let's rethink how we do coding inside ID. So we saw ID forks. And then what's

**[03:54]** ID. So we saw ID forks. And then what's

**[03:54]** ID. So we saw ID forks. And then what's the third wave? Sometimes I hear uh

**[03:56]** the third wave? Sometimes I hear uh

**[03:56]** the third wave? Sometimes I hear uh forking people. I didn't say that. What

**[03:58]** forking people. I didn't say that. What

**[03:58]** forking people. I didn't say that. What I think it actually we're going to see


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** I think it actually we're going to see

**[04:00]** I think it actually we're going to see is like I AI across the SLC. Okay. like

**[04:04]** is like I AI across the SLC. Okay. like

**[04:04]** is like I AI across the SLC. Okay. like being able to do end to end to end uh

**[04:07]** being able to do end to end to end uh

**[04:07]** being able to do end to end to end uh flows that are specific closing a task

**[04:10]** flows that are specific closing a task

**[04:10]** flows that are specific closing a task that is specific in the SDLC but more

**[04:13]** that is specific in the SDLC but more

**[04:13]** that is specific in the SDLC but more importantly using AI across the SDLC

**[04:16]** importantly using AI across the SDLC

**[04:16]** importantly using AI across the SDLC again not and not only in the ID hence

**[04:19]** again not and not only in the ID hence

**[04:19]** again not and not only in the ID hence how do we do that command line right

**[04:21]** how do we do that command line right

**[04:21]** how do we do that command line right it's one of those tools um a lot of

**[04:23]** it's one of those tools um a lot of

**[04:23]** it's one of those tools um a lot of spoilers so I think uh when we had aha

**[04:26]** spoilers so I think uh when we had aha

**[04:26]** spoilers so I think uh when we had aha moment with the uh with autocomplete the

**[04:28]** moment with the uh with autocomplete the

**[04:28]** moment with the uh with autocomplete the next aha moment was you know all the

**[04:30]** next aha moment was you know all the

**[04:30]** next aha moment was you know all the hype around vibe coding and I'm going to

**[04:32]** hype around vibe coding and I'm going to

**[04:32]** hype around vibe coding and I'm going to touch about that and I think the next

**[04:35]** touch about that and I think the next

**[04:35]** touch about that and I think the next like thing that I think we're going to

**[04:36]** like thing that I think we're going to

**[04:36]** like thing that I think we're going to hear about is like hey I'm really doing

**[04:39]** hear about is like hey I'm really doing

**[04:39]** hear about is like hey I'm really doing 100x choose choose a number 10x 50x 100x

**[04:43]** 100x choose choose a number 10x 50x 100x

**[04:43]** 100x choose choose a number 10x 50x 100x development and I I'm doing that with

**[04:45]** development and I I'm doing that with

**[04:45]** development and I I'm doing that with confidence not just like vibing through

**[04:47]** confidence not just like vibing through

**[04:48]** confidence not just like vibing through it I think that that will be a gamecher

**[04:50]** it I think that that will be a gamecher

**[04:50]** it I think that that will be a gamecher uh uh moment uh for for us it means that

**[04:52]** uh uh moment uh for for us it means that

**[04:52]** uh uh moment uh for for us it means that we totally broke the way the way we work

**[04:55]** we totally broke the way the way we work

**[04:55]** we totally broke the way the way we work we're going to get to that so I think

**[04:57]** we're going to get to that so I think

**[04:57]** we're going to get to that so I think like I I differentiated between I

**[04:59]** like I I differentiated between I

**[04:59]** like I I differentiated between I separated between noobs and enterprise


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** separated between noobs and enterprise

**[05:00]** separated between noobs and enterprise for example I think for noobs it mean

**[05:02]** for example I think for noobs it mean

**[05:02]** for example I think for noobs it mean end to end means for example that you

**[05:04]** end to end means for example that you

**[05:04]** end to end means for example that you prompt and get a software a fully

**[05:06]** prompt and get a software a fully

**[05:06]** prompt and get a software a fully managed software for you right we I I

**[05:08]** managed software for you right we I I

**[05:08]** managed software for you right we I I guess we're all playing it with even if

**[05:10]** guess we're all playing it with even if

**[05:10]** guess we're all playing it with even if you're a developer you're doing some

**[05:11]** you're a developer you're doing some

**[05:11]** you're a developer you're doing some POVs or some site or being able to do

**[05:14]** POVs or some site or being able to do

**[05:14]** POVs or some site or being able to do some simple games but then in the

**[05:17]** some simple games but then in the

**[05:17]** some simple games but then in the enterprise setup in the heavy duty setup

**[05:19]** enterprise setup in the heavy duty setup

**[05:19]** enterprise setup in the heavy duty setup then basically what means for us like AI

**[05:21]** then basically what means for us like AI

**[05:22]** then basically what means for us like AI cross this you'll see is reliable

**[05:23]** cross this you'll see is reliable

**[05:23]** cross this you'll see is reliable versatile workflows and when I say

**[05:26]** versatile workflows and when I say

**[05:26]** versatile workflows and when I say workflows we had a few sessions amazing

**[05:28]** workflows we had a few sessions amazing

**[05:28]** workflows we had a few sessions amazing sessions I'm actually like combining

**[05:30]** sessions I'm actually like combining

**[05:30]** sessions I'm actually like combining them and which is one of one of the

**[05:31]** them and which is one of one of the

**[05:31]** them and which is one of one of the points that were made there like uh uh I

**[05:34]** points that were made there like uh uh I

**[05:34]** points that were made there like uh uh I think uh child makes made a made a point

**[05:36]** think uh child makes made a made a point

**[05:36]** think uh child makes made a made a point where an agent is creating workflows and

**[05:38]** where an agent is creating workflows and

**[05:38]** where an agent is creating workflows and calling them and then there was a

**[05:40]** calling them and then there was a

**[05:40]** calling them and then there was a discussion about like workflows and you

**[05:42]** discussion about like workflows and you

**[05:42]** discussion about like workflows and you know using agent etc. So I when I say

**[05:45]** know using agent etc. So I when I say

**[05:45]** know using agent etc. So I when I say workflows I already mean agentic

**[05:47]** workflows I already mean agentic

**[05:47]** workflows I already mean agentic workflow that's let's let's let's move

**[05:48]** workflow that's let's let's let's move

**[05:48]** workflow that's let's let's let's move on like workflow agent who cares like uh

**[05:50]** on like workflow agent who cares like uh

**[05:50]** on like workflow agent who cares like uh like uh so it's going to be combined and

**[05:52]** like uh so it's going to be combined and

**[05:52]** like uh so it's going to be combined and and I think like in order to do that

**[05:54]** and I think like in order to do that

**[05:54]** and I think like in order to do that with trust uh you need to be able more

**[05:57]** with trust uh you need to be able more

**[05:57]** with trust uh you need to be able more importantly is to have workflows or


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** importantly is to have workflows or

**[06:00]** importantly is to have workflows or agents that are related to trust for

**[06:02]** agents that are related to trust for

**[06:02]** agents that are related to trust for example having really high quality

**[06:05]** example having really high quality

**[06:05]** example having really high quality reviewing capabilities really high

**[06:07]** reviewing capabilities really high

**[06:07]** reviewing capabilities really high quality testing capabilities being able

**[06:09]** quality testing capabilities being able

**[06:09]** quality testing capabilities being able to do a variety of jobs to be done that

**[06:12]** to do a variety of jobs to be done that

**[06:12]** to do a variety of jobs to be done that we do as developers end to endish and

**[06:15]** we do as developers end to endish and

**[06:15]** we do as developers end to endish and and high quality. So that will be a game

**[06:16]** and high quality. So that will be a game

**[06:16]** and high quality. So that will be a game changer. Let's be a bit bit more

**[06:18]** changer. Let's be a bit bit more

**[06:18]** changer. Let's be a bit bit more specific as as developers. Uh we do a

**[06:21]** specific as as developers. Uh we do a

**[06:21]** specific as as developers. Uh we do a lot of things and not just write code. I

**[06:22]** lot of things and not just write code. I

**[06:22]** lot of things and not just write code. I took like four parts which is like I

**[06:24]** took like four parts which is like I

**[06:24]** took like four parts which is like I think less than a half of what we do and

**[06:27]** think less than a half of what we do and

**[06:27]** think less than a half of what we do and and I and I think like basically vibe

**[06:29]** and I and I think like basically vibe

**[06:29]** and I and I think like basically vibe coding was very focused on let's like do

**[06:32]** coding was very focused on let's like do

**[06:32]** coding was very focused on let's like do initial planning and and and write code

**[06:34]** initial planning and and and write code

**[06:34]** initial planning and and and write code fast like and you know vibe whatever we

**[06:37]** fast like and you know vibe whatever we

**[06:37]** fast like and you know vibe whatever we get like that implementation or that we

**[06:39]** get like that implementation or that we

**[06:39]** get like that implementation or that we feel it and and move on. But actually in

**[06:42]** feel it and and move on. But actually in

**[06:42]** feel it and and move on. But actually in heavy duty software we need to do many

**[06:44]** heavy duty software we need to do many

**[06:44]** heavy duty software we need to do many other things. We need to do for example

**[06:47]** other things. We need to do for example

**[06:47]** other things. We need to do for example uh bug fixing or we need to do

**[06:49]** uh bug fixing or we need to do

**[06:49]** uh bug fixing or we need to do refactoring and changing features etc.

**[06:52]** refactoring and changing features etc.

**[06:52]** refactoring and changing features etc. We want to move fast without breaking

**[06:53]** We want to move fast without breaking

**[06:53]** We want to move fast without breaking things. So I think we need to have not

**[06:55]** things. So I think we need to have not

**[06:58]** the the testing and the writing as a uh

**[06:58]** the the testing and the writing as a uh a handsite which you can do like testing


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** a handsite which you can do like testing

**[07:01]** a handsite which you can do like testing and and reviewing inside ID tools that

**[07:03]** and and reviewing inside ID tools that

**[07:03]** and and reviewing inside ID tools that are very mature but not as a handsite

**[07:06]** are very mature but not as a handsite

**[07:06]** are very mature but not as a handsite but rather like really being the the red

**[07:09]** but rather like really being the the red

**[07:09]** but rather like really being the the red team right thinking as a as a tech lead

**[07:11]** team right thinking as a as a tech lead

**[07:11]** team right thinking as a as a tech lead that is reviewing code and and having

**[07:13]** that is reviewing code and and having

**[07:13]** that is reviewing code and and having like fitting technology uh uh for that.

**[07:16]** like fitting technology uh uh for that.

**[07:16]** like fitting technology uh uh for that. So if we are able to to put like AI in

**[07:19]** So if we are able to to put like AI in

**[07:19]** So if we are able to to put like AI in each one of those like parts maybe then

**[07:22]** each one of those like parts maybe then

**[07:22]** each one of those like parts maybe then it will be a gamecher but I think even

**[07:25]** it will be a gamecher but I think even

**[07:25]** it will be a gamecher but I think even then like we already have tools for for

**[07:27]** then like we already have tools for for

**[07:27]** then like we already have tools for for code review for testing shameless plug

**[07:29]** code review for testing shameless plug

**[07:29]** code review for testing shameless plug we're going to talk about later that's

**[07:31]** we're going to talk about later that's

**[07:31]** we're going to talk about later that's what we do at KOD we focus being more on

**[07:33]** what we do at KOD we focus being more on

**[07:33]** what we do at KOD we focus being more on the red team even though we have tools

**[07:34]** the red team even though we have tools

**[07:34]** the red team even though we have tools for the blue we focus more on the red

**[07:36]** for the blue we focus more on the red

**[07:36]** for the blue we focus more on the red team still I don't think it's a gamecher

**[07:39]** team still I don't think it's a gamecher

**[07:39]** team still I don't think it's a gamecher okay and I think like a first like a

**[07:42]** okay and I think like a first like a

**[07:42]** okay and I think like a first like a feeling of a game changanger as I

**[07:43]** feeling of a game changanger as I

**[07:43]** feeling of a game changanger as I mentioned not only putting AI across to

**[07:45]** mentioned not only putting AI across to

**[07:45]** mentioned not only putting AI across to CLC but having workflows across parts of

**[07:49]** CLC but having workflows across parts of

**[07:49]** CLC but having workflows across parts of the SDLC. So one semi gamecher could be

**[07:52]** the SDLC. So one semi gamecher could be

**[07:52]** the SDLC. So one semi gamecher could be like if we manage to shift left the

**[07:55]** like if we manage to shift left the

**[07:55]** like if we manage to shift left the review and the testing is as you write

**[07:57]** review and the testing is as you write

**[07:57]** review and the testing is as you write code then you also get those suggestion

**[07:59]** code then you also get those suggestion

**[07:59]** code then you also get those suggestion and get high quality code uh uh that is


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:02]** and get high quality code uh uh that is

**[08:02]** and get high quality code uh uh that is already according to your company best

**[08:03]** already according to your company best

**[08:03]** already according to your company best practices and you don't need to wait for

**[08:05]** practices and you don't need to wait for

**[08:05]** practices and you don't need to wait for the AI review tool to tell you that only

**[08:07]** the AI review tool to tell you that only

**[08:08]** the AI review tool to tell you that only after you pushed it right but I think

**[08:10]** after you pushed it right but I think

**[08:10]** after you pushed it right but I think like uh I think we we have even a better

**[08:12]** like uh I think we we have even a better

**[08:12]** like uh I think we we have even a better way to do that a bit more agentic so

**[08:15]** way to do that a bit more agentic so

**[08:15]** way to do that a bit more agentic so let's an reanalyze the these four blocks

**[08:18]** let's an reanalyze the these four blocks

**[08:18]** let's an reanalyze the these four blocks these four tasks

**[08:19]** these four tasks

**[08:20]** these four tasks So uh I instead of having one like the

**[08:22]** So uh I instead of having one like the

**[08:22]** So uh I instead of having one like the x-axis now there's also y-axis it's

**[08:25]** x-axis now there's also y-axis it's

**[08:25]** x-axis now there's also y-axis it's executed

**[08:28]** executed

**[08:28]** executed or whatever where you're searching now

**[08:30]** or whatever where you're searching now

**[08:30]** or whatever where you're searching now chatgpt vshape software development

**[08:32]** chatgpt vshape software development

**[08:32]** chatgpt vshape software development y-axis executability uh x-axis time so

**[08:35]** y-axis executability uh x-axis time so

**[08:35]** y-axis executability uh x-axis time so we start with planning it's not

**[08:36]** we start with planning it's not

**[08:36]** we start with planning it's not executable then we write code in most

**[08:38]** executable then we write code in most

**[08:38]** executable then we write code in most cases you're not doing admit it like a

**[08:40]** cases you're not doing admit it like a

**[08:40]** cases you're not doing admit it like a TDD okay so you write you write your

**[08:43]** TDD okay so you write you write your

**[08:43]** TDD okay so you write you write your code and then you write your test uh and

**[08:46]** code and then you write your test uh and

**[08:46]** code and then you write your test uh and in most cases and that's executable but

**[08:47]** in most cases and that's executable but

**[08:47]** in most cases and that's executable but it's not application code so So it's a

**[08:49]** it's not application code so So it's a

**[08:49]** it's not application code so So it's a bit higher and then and then you do the

**[08:50]** bit higher and then and then you do the

**[08:50]** bit higher and then and then you do the review. A game changer is like when we

**[08:53]** review. A game changer is like when we

**[08:53]** review. A game changer is like when we actually manage to take that V and

**[08:55]** actually manage to take that V and

**[08:56]** actually manage to take that V and squeeze it and and have like different

**[08:58]** squeeze it and and have like different

**[08:58]** squeeze it and and have like different workflows and agents talking to each


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** workflows and agents talking to each

**[09:00]** workflows and agents talking to each other. And that's why like I had the

**[09:02]** other. And that's why like I had the

**[09:02]** other. And that's why like I had the word MCP and A2A and I'm going to get to

**[09:04]** word MCP and A2A and I'm going to get to

**[09:04]** word MCP and A2A and I'm going to get to that later. I I I I'm guess if you're in

**[09:08]** this conference, you know what I'm

**[09:08]** this conference, you know what I'm talking about that where maybe there's

**[09:20]** be a gamecher. So to and to some extent

**[09:20]** be a gamecher. So to and to some extent what it means is that that uh like the

**[09:22]** what it means is that that uh like the

**[09:28]** rigorously and in one holistic uh uh solution if you like uh cloud is is

**[09:32]** solution if you like uh cloud is is

**[09:32]** solution if you like uh cloud is is mature for 10 years and then whiz came

**[09:34]** mature for 10 years and then whiz came

**[09:34]** mature for 10 years and then whiz came and said we can't put an a security

**[09:36]** and said we can't put an a security

**[09:36]** and said we can't put an a security application for each part of the cloud

**[09:38]** application for each part of the cloud

**[09:57]** it it didn't happen a long time ago when

**[09:57]** it it didn't happen a long time ago when Karpati and uh wrote about vibe coding


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** Karpati and uh wrote about vibe coding

**[10:00]** Karpati and uh wrote about vibe coding like you really like I thought it like a

**[10:02]** like you really like I thought it like a

**[10:02]** like you really like I thought it like a decade already in AI uh years. uh and

**[10:05]** decade already in AI uh years. uh and

**[10:06]** decade already in AI uh years. uh and and the interesting thing it didn't take

**[10:07]** and the interesting thing it didn't take

**[10:07]** and the interesting thing it didn't take too much time like a month or two uh

**[10:10]** too much time like a month or two uh

**[10:10]** too much time like a month or two uh where where we started where where we

**[10:12]** where where we started where where we

**[10:12]** where where we started where where we started seeing push backs right this is

**[10:14]** started seeing push backs right this is

**[10:14]** started seeing push backs right this is not me by the way uh and and uh and and

**[10:18]** not me by the way uh and and uh and and

**[10:18]** not me by the way uh and and uh and and actually just a few weeks ago the same

**[10:20]** actually just a few weeks ago the same

**[10:20]** actually just a few weeks ago the same karpati came back and rethought vibe

**[10:23]** karpati came back and rethought vibe

**[10:23]** karpati came back and rethought vibe coding notice what he's saying like code

**[10:26]** coding notice what he's saying like code

**[10:26]** coding notice what he's saying like code I actually and professionally care about

**[10:28]** I actually and professionally care about

**[10:28]** I actually and professionally care about contrast vibe code the same karpati okay

**[10:31]** contrast vibe code the same karpati okay

**[10:31]** contrast vibe code the same karpati okay and it's really interesting I think to

**[10:33]** and it's really interesting I think to

**[10:33]** and it's really interesting I think to analyze what he's saying the first thing

**[10:35]** analyze what he's saying the first thing

**[10:35]** analyze what he's saying the first thing He's saying okay code that I care about

**[10:37]** He's saying okay code that I care about

**[10:37]** He's saying okay code that I care about probably heavy duty software or I like

**[10:39]** probably heavy duty software or I like

**[10:39]** probably heavy duty software or I like the quality it's maintainable like we

**[10:41]** the quality it's maintainable like we

**[10:41]** the quality it's maintainable like we I'm going to get to that and then he's

**[10:43]** I'm going to get to that and then he's

**[10:43]** I'm going to get to that and then he's he tries to offer solution I love him I

**[10:46]** he tries to offer solution I love him I

**[10:46]** he tries to offer solution I love him I I mean I never met him but but uh we all

**[10:48]** I mean I never met him but but uh we all

**[10:48]** I mean I never met him but but uh we all saw his videos right like 15 years ago

**[10:50]** saw his videos right like 15 years ago

**[10:50]** saw his videos right like 15 years ago 10 years ago so uh he's giving solution

**[10:52]** 10 years ago so uh he's giving solution

**[10:52]** 10 years ago so uh he's giving solution not only like uh like being annoying

**[10:54]** not only like uh like being annoying

**[10:54]** not only like uh like being annoying like okay no I said v coding no v coding

**[10:57]** like okay no I said v coding no v coding

**[10:57]** like okay no I said v coding no v coding anymore so first he's saying the first

**[10:59]** anymore so first he's saying the first

**[10:59]** anymore so first he's saying the first number one is is context he's saying


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:01]** number one is is context he's saying

**[11:01]** number one is is context he's saying like bring context

**[11:03]** like bring context

**[11:03]** like bring context here he's saying doing it manual But

**[11:04]** here he's saying doing it manual But

**[11:04]** here he's saying doing it manual But that's not game changer if now I need to

**[11:06]** that's not game changer if now I need to

**[11:06]** that's not game changer if now I need to start bringing it manually. And then

**[11:08]** start bringing it manually. And then

**[11:08]** start bringing it manually. And then he's giving also two three four five six

**[11:11]** he's giving also two three four five six

**[11:11]** he's giving also two three four five six seven like this this is a workflow. He's

**[11:14]** seven like this this is a workflow. He's

**[11:17]** one of the topics of the three talks

**[11:18]** one of the topics of the three talks that we had now. Okay. So now uh like

**[11:21]** that we had now. Okay. So now uh like

**[11:21]** that we had now. Okay. So now uh like this is really important I think like

**[11:23]** this is really important I think like

**[11:23]** this is really important I think like how do you vibe code with confidence?

**[11:25]** how do you vibe code with confidence?

**[11:25]** how do you vibe code with confidence? You need to like you said like just vibe

**[11:27]** You need to like you said like just vibe

**[11:28]** You need to like you said like just vibe coding probably you don't care about

**[11:29]** coding probably you don't care about

**[11:29]** coding probably you don't care about qual quality. You do care. You need to

**[11:31]** qual quality. You do care. You need to

**[11:31]** qual quality. You do care. You need to bring the right context and have

**[11:33]** bring the right context and have

**[11:33]** bring the right context and have workflows and these workflows can be

**[11:49]** ago if you you know this a very great

**[11:49]** ago if you you know this a very great great person great material he's saying

**[11:51]** great person great material he's saying

**[11:52]** great person great material he's saying like AI coding tools are so much less

**[11:54]** like AI coding tools are so much less

**[11:54]** like AI coding tools are so much less useful on existing large code bases okay

**[11:58]** useful on existing large code bases okay

**[11:58]** useful on existing large code bases okay he he's saying that and and is this is


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** he he's saying that and and is this is

**[12:00]** he he's saying that and and is this is differently than compared green green

**[12:02]** differently than compared green green

**[12:02]** differently than compared green green field work and it's not surprising

**[12:04]** field work and it's not surprising

**[12:04]** field work and it's not surprising because if you have a green field work

**[12:06]** because if you have a green field work

**[12:06]** because if you have a green field work or it's a simple software code

**[12:08]** or it's a simple software code

**[12:08]** or it's a simple software code generation is all you need okay like

**[12:11]** generation is all you need okay like

**[12:11]** generation is all you need okay like it's magnificent the tip of the iceberg

**[12:14]** it's magnificent the tip of the iceberg

**[12:14]** it's magnificent the tip of the iceberg give a prompt you get your software but

**[12:16]** give a prompt you get your software but

**[12:16]** give a prompt you get your software but when you're talking about enterprise

**[12:18]** when you're talking about enterprise

**[12:18]** when you're talking about enterprise heavy duty software then there's much

**[12:20]** heavy duty software then there's much

**[12:20]** heavy duty software then there's much more than that we all know it right

**[12:21]** more than that we all know it right

**[12:21]** more than that we all know it right there is a maintainability testing

**[12:23]** there is a maintainability testing

**[12:23]** there is a maintainability testing reviewing etc and shameless plug well I

**[12:25]** reviewing etc and shameless plug well I

**[12:28]** am the CEO codto I have to say we are

**[12:28]** am the CEO codto I have to say we are looking at that as a holistic like how

**[12:30]** looking at that as a holistic like how

**[12:30]** looking at that as a holistic like how can we really bring a gamecher moment is

**[12:33]** can we really bring a gamecher moment is

**[12:33]** can we really bring a gamecher moment is if we look at all of this at a holistic

**[12:34]** if we look at all of this at a holistic

**[12:34]** if we look at all of this at a holistic approach that's why uh we have a multi-

**[13:42]** with the workflow parts. The workflow is already integrated into our solution.

**[13:44]** already integrated into our solution.

**[13:44]** already integrated into our solution. But this like really uh or workflow and

**[13:47]** But this like really uh or workflow and

**[13:47]** But this like really uh or workflow and on steroids. There's another thing very

**[13:49]** on steroids. There's another thing very

**[13:49]** on steroids. There's another thing very important that is coming out in two

**[13:50]** important that is coming out in two

**[13:50]** important that is coming out in two months and stay tuned follow us whatever

**[13:53]** months and stay tuned follow us whatever

**[13:53]** months and stay tuned follow us whatever any platform that that you want. I kind

**[13:55]** any platform that that you want. I kind

**[13:55]** any platform that that you want. I kind of like uh didn't want to show it right

**[13:57]** of like uh didn't want to show it right

**[13:57]** of like uh didn't want to show it right now. So CLI tool why I hope like I gave


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** now. So CLI tool why I hope like I gave

**[14:00]** now. So CLI tool why I hope like I gave enough like hints um and so far and the

**[14:04]** enough like hints um and so far and the

**[14:04]** enough like hints um and so far and the main reason is putting AI to work across

**[14:06]** main reason is putting AI to work across

**[14:06]** main reason is putting AI to work across the CLC and I remind you that starting

**[14:08]** the CLC and I remind you that starting

**[14:08]** the CLC and I remind you that starting five minutes ago you can go download it

**[14:10]** five minutes ago you can go download it

**[14:10]** five minutes ago you can go download it and play with it. It's a soft launch uh

**[14:12]** and play with it. It's a soft launch uh

**[14:12]** and play with it. It's a soft launch uh we're going to announce about it more

**[14:13]** we're going to announce about it more

**[14:13]** we're going to announce about it more deeply like in in in a couple of weeks.

**[14:16]** deeply like in in in a couple of weeks.

**[14:16]** deeply like in in in a couple of weeks. So interestingly who who saw Simon's

**[14:18]** So interestingly who who saw Simon's

**[14:18]** So interestingly who who saw Simon's like uh talk like he's magnificent. Some

**[14:21]** like uh talk like he's magnificent. Some

**[14:21]** like uh talk like he's magnificent. Some people didn't. Okay. So, please go uh go

**[14:24]** people didn't. Okay. So, please go uh go

**[14:24]** people didn't. Okay. So, please go uh go out of the room, I mean, and uh and then

**[14:26]** out of the room, I mean, and uh and then

**[14:26]** out of the room, I mean, and uh and then come back after and watch uh online

**[14:29]** come back after and watch uh online

**[14:29]** come back after and watch uh online later. And it's amazing like when he

**[14:32]** later. And it's amazing like when he

**[14:32]** later. And it's amazing like when he wanted to demonstrate something, did he

**[14:34]** wanted to demonstrate something, did he

**[14:34]** wanted to demonstrate something, did he open like one of the IDEs? He did not.

**[14:37]** open like one of the IDEs? He did not.

**[14:37]** open like one of the IDEs? He did not. Like everything he did was with with a

**[14:39]** Like everything he did was with with a

**[14:39]** Like everything he did was with with a CLI tool. Like that's if you are a

**[14:42]** CLI tool. Like that's if you are a

**[14:42]** CLI tool. Like that's if you are a developer like that's idea that you can

**[14:44]** developer like that's idea that you can

**[14:44]** developer like that's idea that you can run it in the background, you can run it

**[14:45]** run it in the background, you can run it

**[14:45]** run it in the background, you can run it in different workflows. You can make

**[14:47]** in different workflows. You can make

**[14:47]** in different workflows. You can make workflows. That's part of what I'm what

**[14:49]** workflows. That's part of what I'm what

**[14:49]** workflows. That's part of what I'm what I'm going to show you. And and basically

**[14:51]** I'm going to show you. And and basically

**[14:51]** I'm going to show you. And and basically with with Kodto uh the CLI tool which is

**[14:55]** with with Kodto uh the CLI tool which is

**[14:55]** with with Kodto uh the CLI tool which is live uh live here then I can for example

**[14:58]** live uh live here then I can for example

**[14:58]** live uh live here then I can for example chat with it and very interestingly that


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:01]** chat with it and very interestingly that

**[15:01]** chat with it and very interestingly that is very quite like there are a few tools

**[15:03]** is very quite like there are a few tools

**[15:03]** is very quite like there are a few tools that we talked about before that you can

**[15:04]** that we talked about before that you can

**[15:04]** that we talked about before that you can do that but interestingly you can call

**[15:06]** do that but interestingly you can call

**[15:06]** do that but interestingly you can call agents for example I can call the the

**[15:08]** agents for example I can call the the

**[15:08]** agents for example I can call the the explain agent it's a dedicated agent uh

**[15:11]** explain agent it's a dedicated agent uh

**[15:11]** explain agent it's a dedicated agent uh due to lack of time I'm not going to

**[15:12]** due to lack of time I'm not going to

**[15:12]** due to lack of time I'm not going to show that I'm going to show something

**[15:14]** show that I'm going to show something

**[15:14]** show that I'm going to show something else. So how does how did we made this

**[15:17]** else. So how does how did we made this

**[15:17]** else. So how does how did we made this explain agent? You can actually with

**[15:19]** explain agent? You can actually with

**[15:19]** explain agent? You can actually with Kodo the agent you can make other agents

**[15:22]** Kodo the agent you can make other agents

**[15:22]** Kodo the agent you can make other agents and soon I'm going to show you how you

**[15:24]** and soon I'm going to show you how you

**[15:24]** and soon I'm going to show you how you also create workflows and things like

**[15:26]** also create workflows and things like

**[15:26]** also create workflows and things like that. So basically I can go and ask it

**[15:28]** that. So basically I can go and ask it

**[15:28]** that. So basically I can go and ask it if the internet works uh well enough. Uh

**[15:31]** if the internet works uh well enough. Uh

**[15:31]** if the internet works uh well enough. Uh you can go and ask it please create an

**[15:33]** you can go and ask it please create an

**[15:33]** you can go and ask it please create an agent with this goal and and by the way

**[15:36]** agent with this goal and and by the way

**[15:36]** agent with this goal and and by the way you can uh uh like give much more

**[15:38]** you can uh uh like give much more

**[15:38]** you can uh uh like give much more information than what I'm doing right

**[15:39]** information than what I'm doing right

**[15:39]** information than what I'm doing right now. I'm asking for it to create a

**[15:42]** now. I'm asking for it to create a

**[15:42]** now. I'm asking for it to create a review agent. Okay, if Thunder works,

**[15:45]** review agent. Okay, if Thunder works,

**[15:45]** review agent. Okay, if Thunder works, it's it's going to start working. It's

**[15:47]** it's it's going to start working. It's

**[15:47]** it's it's going to start working. It's initializing MCP is going to search what

**[15:49]** initializing MCP is going to search what

**[15:49]** initializing MCP is going to search what it can do, what it cannot do. And it now

**[15:51]** it can do, what it cannot do. And it now

**[15:51]** it can do, what it cannot do. And it now it's it's going to work for for a few

**[15:53]** it's it's going to work for for a few

**[15:53]** it's it's going to work for for a few minutes. Okay, like if I would ask you

**[15:55]** minutes. Okay, like if I would ask you

**[15:55]** minutes. Okay, like if I would ask you to do it, you would do it take two

**[15:56]** to do it, you would do it take two

**[15:56]** to do it, you would do it take two hours. So, let's give it two minutes.

**[15:58]** hours. So, let's give it two minutes.

**[15:58]** hours. So, let's give it two minutes. Meanwhile, I'm going to to progress and


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:00]** Meanwhile, I'm going to to progress and

**[16:00]** Meanwhile, I'm going to to progress and and uh and and tell you that that I

**[16:03]** and uh and and tell you that that I

**[16:03]** and uh and and tell you that that I think one of the interesting things uh

**[16:05]** think one of the interesting things uh

**[16:05]** think one of the interesting things uh about it, it's it's working. So one uh

**[16:08]** about it, it's it's working. So one uh

**[16:08]** about it, it's it's working. So one uh most agents like I can't think of of one

**[16:12]** most agents like I can't think of of one

**[16:12]** most agents like I can't think of of one that won't would have tools uh for

**[16:14]** that won't would have tools uh for

**[16:14]** that won't would have tools uh for example the codto cover agent uh by the

**[16:17]** example the codto cover agent uh by the

**[16:17]** example the codto cover agent uh by the way we have an open source for codto

**[16:19]** way we have an open source for codto

**[16:19]** way we have an open source for codto cover uh it's a tool that automatically

**[16:22]** cover uh it's a tool that automatically

**[16:22]** cover uh it's a tool that automatically uh generates coverage coverage uh it

**[16:25]** uh generates coverage coverage uh it

**[16:26]** uh generates coverage coverage uh it increases the coverage automatically

**[16:28]** increases the coverage automatically

**[16:28]** increases the coverage automatically increases coverage but you don't need

**[16:29]** increases coverage but you don't need

**[16:29]** increases coverage but you don't need anymore to go download this open source

**[16:32]** anymore to go download this open source

**[16:32]** anymore to go download this open source etc you just get it as part of the uh as

**[16:35]** etc you just get it as part of the uh as

**[16:35]** etc you just get it as part of the uh as one of the agent

**[16:36]** one of the agent

**[16:36]** one of the agent Okay. So, uh but if you do want to play

**[16:38]** Okay. So, uh but if you do want to play

**[16:38]** Okay. So, uh but if you do want to play with the open source, etc. It's it's

**[16:40]** with the open source, etc. It's it's

**[16:40]** with the open source, etc. It's it's it's fully open source. Okay. Back back

**[16:42]** it's fully open source. Okay. Back back

**[16:42]** it's fully open source. Okay. Back back to my point. I can go and call cover

**[16:45]** to my point. I can go and call cover

**[16:45]** to my point. I can go and call cover which uses different tools. For example,

**[16:46]** which uses different tools. For example,

**[16:46]** which uses different tools. For example, it uses tools related to coverage

**[16:48]** it uses tools related to coverage

**[16:48]** it uses tools related to coverage reports and and you I can look what I

**[16:50]** reports and and you I can look what I

**[16:50]** reports and and you I can look what I can do in a command line. I can tell it

**[16:52]** can do in a command line. I can tell it

**[16:52]** can do in a command line. I can tell it dump all the logs somewhere, right? How

**[16:54]** dump all the logs somewhere, right? How

**[16:54]** dump all the logs somewhere, right? How do you do that with an ID plugin? You

**[16:56]** do you do that with an ID plugin? You

**[16:56]** do you do that with an ID plugin? You can, but you need to hack it. Hack it.

**[16:59]** can, but you need to hack it. Hack it.

**[16:59]** can, but you need to hack it. Hack it. But the interesting thing, what can we


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:00]** But the interesting thing, what can we

**[17:00]** But the interesting thing, what can we do with command lines? And many here are

**[17:02]** do with command lines? And many here are

**[17:02]** do with command lines? And many here are are developers. You can pipe you can

**[17:05]** are developers. You can pipe you can

**[17:05]** are developers. You can pipe you can pipe uh uh tools together agents you can

**[17:08]** pipe uh uh tools together agents you can

**[17:08]** pipe uh uh tools together agents you can pipe like uh uh uh workflows etc. So I

**[17:11]** pipe like uh uh uh workflows etc. So I

**[17:11]** pipe like uh uh uh workflows etc. So I want to run code of code generating code

**[17:13]** want to run code of code generating code

**[17:13]** want to run code of code generating code and then I want to run the cover that

**[17:15]** and then I want to run the cover that

**[17:15]** and then I want to run the cover that like you know increase the coverage

**[17:17]** like you know increase the coverage

**[17:17]** like you know increase the coverage testing maybe the code will generate a

**[17:19]** testing maybe the code will generate a

**[17:19]** testing maybe the code will generate a few tests but I have an agent that is

**[17:21]** few tests but I have an agent that is

**[17:21]** few tests but I have an agent that is specializing in increasing coverage and

**[17:23]** specializing in increasing coverage and

**[17:23]** specializing in increasing coverage and then I want a review agent that is now

**[17:25]** then I want a review agent that is now

**[17:25]** then I want a review agent that is now cooking and finished. Uh um and I'll go

**[17:28]** cooking and finished. Uh um and I'll go

**[17:28]** cooking and finished. Uh um and I'll go back to it in a minute if I have time.

**[17:30]** back to it in a minute if I have time.

**[17:30]** back to it in a minute if I have time. Now this is not no agent to engine

**[17:33]** Now this is not no agent to engine

**[17:33]** Now this is not no agent to engine communication. I did a pipeline that

**[17:34]** communication. I did a pipeline that

**[17:34]** communication. I did a pipeline that just passed a result. But what if we can

**[17:37]** just passed a result. But what if we can

**[17:37]** just passed a result. But what if we can and and before I exemplified with MCP

**[17:40]** and and before I exemplified with MCP

**[17:40]** and and before I exemplified with MCP but what if we can invent a command line

**[17:43]** but what if we can invent a command line

**[17:43]** but what if we can invent a command line for A2A. So those agents are will run in

**[17:46]** for A2A. So those agents are will run in

**[17:46]** for A2A. So those agents are will run in parallel as you go and they will have

**[17:49]** parallel as you go and they will have

**[17:49]** parallel as you go and they will have some communication uh between them. So I

**[17:52]** some communication uh between them. So I

**[17:52]** some communication uh between them. So I actually have to say that yesterday we

**[17:53]** actually have to say that yesterday we

**[17:53]** actually have to say that yesterday we had like a 20 uh 50 uh like people like

**[17:56]** had like a 20 uh 50 uh like people like

**[17:56]** had like a 20 uh 50 uh like people like like those that you had we the speakers

**[17:59]** like those that you had we the speakers

**[17:59]** like those that you had we the speakers and I asked who is using A2A no one is


### [18:00 - 19:00]

**[18:02]** and I asked who is using A2A no one is

**[18:02]** and I asked who is using A2A no one is using it so it's still way to go but

**[18:05]** using it so it's still way to go but

**[18:05]** using it so it's still way to go but this is an example oh yes come talk to

**[18:07]** this is an example oh yes come talk to

**[18:07]** this is an example oh yes come talk to me later so I'll know one person okay

**[18:09]** me later so I'll know one person okay

**[18:09]** me later so I'll know one person okay thank you so uh and then I'll edit all

**[18:13]** thank you so uh and then I'll edit all

**[18:13]** thank you so uh and then I'll edit all the posts I know one person and and uh

**[18:15]** the posts I know one person and and uh

**[18:15]** the posts I know one person and and uh and and but but we're getting there okay

**[18:17]** and and but but we're getting there okay

**[18:17]** and and but but we're getting there okay this is an example you need multiple

**[18:19]** this is an example you need multiple

**[18:19]** this is an example you need multiple agents you need A2A Okay, you you would

**[18:21]** agents you need A2A Okay, you you would

**[18:21]** agents you need A2A Okay, you you would want to use it if you want discover

**[18:23]** want to use it if you want discover

**[18:23]** want to use it if you want discover discoverability between agents or

**[18:25]** discoverability between agents or

**[18:25]** discoverability between agents or handshakes. So this is a good example if

**[18:27]** handshakes. So this is a good example if

**[18:27]** handshakes. So this is a good example if you have many agents and you can run

**[18:29]** you have many agents and you can run

**[18:29]** you have many agents and you can run them in the background etc. So in this

**[18:31]** them in the background etc. So in this

**[18:31]** them in the background etc. So in this case the agent finished and I have the

**[18:33]** case the agent finished and I have the

**[18:33]** case the agent finished and I have the definition uh I have the definition of

**[18:35]** definition uh I have the definition of

**[18:35]** definition uh I have the definition of the of the agent uh over over here. Uh

**[18:39]** the of the agent uh over over here. Uh

**[18:39]** the of the agent uh over over here. Uh it's called merge agent and you can see

**[18:41]** it's called merge agent and you can see

**[18:42]** it's called merge agent and you can see like like all everything the

**[18:44]** like like all everything the

**[18:44]** like like all everything the instructions that was made for it uh

**[18:46]** instructions that was made for it uh

**[18:46]** instructions that was made for it uh like what tools it is is using uh I'm

**[18:48]** like what tools it is is using uh I'm

**[18:48]** like what tools it is is using uh I'm going to add one that uh sometime I want

**[18:51]** going to add one that uh sometime I want

**[18:51]** going to add one that uh sometime I want to be very clear it's there and by the

**[18:53]** to be very clear it's there and by the

**[18:53]** to be very clear it's there and by the way it also has like a output scheme.

**[18:55]** way it also has like a output scheme.

**[18:56]** way it also has like a output scheme. I'm going to remove that remove that for

**[18:57]** I'm going to remove that remove that for

**[18:58]** I'm going to remove that remove that for a second. Okay. And then I can go back


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:01]** a second. Okay. And then I can go back

**[19:01]** a second. Okay. And then I can go back uh and and just call it it was called

**[19:04]** uh and and just call it it was called

**[19:04]** uh and and just call it it was called merge review uh codto merge uh review

**[19:08]** merge review uh codto merge uh review

**[19:08]** merge review uh codto merge uh review agent that was just generated a minute

**[19:10]** agent that was just generated a minute

**[19:10]** agent that was just generated a minute ago and it will review. I didn't give it

**[19:13]** ago and it will review. I didn't give it

**[19:13]** ago and it will review. I didn't give it any you see that there's a parameter

**[19:15]** any you see that there's a parameter

**[19:15]** any you see that there's a parameter automatically created like uh uh uh that

**[19:18]** automatically created like uh uh uh that

**[19:18]** automatically created like uh uh uh that that uh uh I I can tell it what to

**[19:20]** that uh uh I I can tell it what to

**[19:20]** that uh uh I I can tell it what to review etc give instruction it's very

**[19:22]** review etc give instruction it's very

**[19:22]** review etc give instruction it's very flexible but I didn't okay so uh I'm

**[19:25]** flexible but I didn't okay so uh I'm

**[19:25]** flexible but I didn't okay so uh I'm almost stack of time so I won't uh show

**[19:27]** almost stack of time so I won't uh show

**[19:27]** almost stack of time so I won't uh show you but what I just will tell you that

**[19:29]** you but what I just will tell you that

**[19:29]** you but what I just will tell you that basically I can tell it to use best

**[19:31]** basically I can tell it to use best

**[19:31]** basically I can tell it to use best practices from the organization

**[19:33]** practices from the organization

**[19:33]** practices from the organization important for vibe coding with

**[19:34]** important for vibe coding with

**[19:34]** important for vibe coding with confidence and I can also tell it to

**[19:36]** confidence and I can also tell it to

**[19:36]** confidence and I can also tell it to have some success or or or failure

**[19:40]** have some success or or or failure

**[19:40]** have some success or or or failure criteria to know that something happen

**[19:42]** criteria to know that something happen

**[19:42]** criteria to know that something happen well or not. For example, if it managed

**[19:44]** well or not. For example, if it managed

**[19:44]** well or not. For example, if it managed to get some coverage, okay, that's how

**[19:46]** to get some coverage, okay, that's how

**[19:46]** to get some coverage, okay, that's how you work with with confidence. Um, yeah,

**[19:49]** you work with with confidence. Um, yeah,

**[19:49]** you work with with confidence. Um, yeah, and you can connect things to

**[19:50]** and you can connect things to

**[19:50]** and you can connect things to pre-commit, postcommit. Okay, everything

**[19:54]** pre-commit, postcommit. Okay, everything

**[19:54]** pre-commit, postcommit. Okay, everything you can do, you can do automatically.

**[19:55]** you can do, you can do automatically.

**[19:55]** you can do, you can do automatically. Very interestingly, and and with that

**[19:58]** Very interestingly, and and with that

**[19:58]** Very interestingly, and and with that almost reached the end, very very


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:00]** almost reached the end, very very

**[20:00]** almost reached the end, very very interestingly, you can say the CLI tool

**[20:02]** interestingly, you can say the CLI tool

**[20:02]** interestingly, you can say the CLI tool is very lame.

**[20:05]** is very lame.

**[20:05]** is very lame. But notice, did you notice what what

**[20:07]** But notice, did you notice what what

**[20:07]** But notice, did you notice what what Simon did? He used the CLI but

**[20:09]** Simon did? He used the CLI but

**[20:09]** Simon did? He used the CLI but eventually checking content he he used

**[20:11]** eventually checking content he he used

**[20:12]** eventually checking content he he used different interfaces. So you can from

**[20:15]** different interfaces. So you can from

**[20:15]** different interfaces. So you can from the CLI itself automatically generate

**[20:17]** the CLI itself automatically generate

**[20:17]** the CLI itself automatically generate interfaces that are fitting for your

**[20:19]** interfaces that are fitting for your

**[20:20]** interfaces that are fitting for your task. And one of those for example is an

**[20:22]** task. And one of those for example is an
