**[00:07]** Hi, I'm Offer from Victara. At Victara,

**[00:07]** Hi, I'm Offer from Victara. At Victara, we developed a trustworthy agent

**[00:09]** we developed a trustworthy agent

**[00:09]** we developed a trustworthy agent operating system. And there's a lot of

**[00:11]** operating system. And there's a lot of

**[00:11]** operating system. And there's a lot of really cool use cases with this like

**[00:13]** really cool use cases with this like

**[00:13]** really cool use cases with this like document generation, conversational AI

**[00:16]** document generation, conversational AI

**[00:16]** document generation, conversational AI or chat bots, either internal or

**[00:19]** or chat bots, either internal or

**[00:19]** or chat bots, either internal or external, and enterprise deep research,

**[00:21]** external, and enterprise deep research,

**[00:21]** external, and enterprise deep research, which I'm going to talk about today. But

**[00:23]** which I'm going to talk about today. But

**[00:23]** which I'm going to talk about today. But before I jump into Enterprise Deep

**[00:25]** before I jump into Enterprise Deep

**[00:25]** before I jump into Enterprise Deep Research, let me tell you a little bit

**[00:27]** Research, let me tell you a little bit

**[00:27]** Research, let me tell you a little bit more about our operating system for

**[00:29]** more about our operating system for

**[00:29]** more about our operating system for agents. First of all, it's a SAS

**[00:31]** agents. First of all, it's a SAS

**[00:32]** agents. First of all, it's a SAS platform, but also runs on your own VPC

**[00:34]** platform, but also runs on your own VPC

**[00:34]** platform, but also runs on your own VPC or on premise in your own data center.

**[00:37]** or on premise in your own data center.

**[00:38]** or on premise in your own data center. And here's some of the main features

**[00:39]** And here's some of the main features

**[00:39]** And here's some of the main features that we really are proud of. We have

**[00:43]** that we really are proud of. We have

**[00:43]** that we really are proud of. We have very advanced multimodal injust to

**[00:45]** very advanced multimodal injust to

**[00:45]** very advanced multimodal injust to support images, tables in a way that

**[00:49]** support images, tables in a way that

**[00:49]** support images, tables in a way that makes them, you know, findable and

**[00:51]** makes them, you know, findable and

**[00:51]** makes them, you know, findable and retrieved to be able to make sense of

**[00:53]** retrieved to be able to make sense of

**[00:53]** retrieved to be able to make sense of them in a in a rag or a gentic rag

**[00:55]** them in a in a rag or a gentic rag

**[00:55]** them in a in a rag or a gentic rag workflow. Very strong focus on again

**[00:58]** workflow. Very strong focus on again

**[00:58]** workflow. Very strong focus on again retrieval accuracy with hybrid


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** retrieval accuracy with hybrid

**[01:00]** retrieval accuracy with hybrid retrieval, lots of features around

**[01:02]** retrieval, lots of features around

**[01:02]** retrieval, lots of features around metadata, reranking, etc. And then we're

**[01:06]** metadata, reranking, etc. And then we're

**[01:06]** metadata, reranking, etc. And then we're we're kind of known for a lot of work

**[01:08]** we're kind of known for a lot of work

**[01:08]** we're kind of known for a lot of work around hallucination mitigation, both

**[01:10]** around hallucination mitigation, both

**[01:10]** around hallucination mitigation, both hallucination detection and correction.

**[01:12]** hallucination detection and correction.

**[01:12]** hallucination detection and correction. In fact, our hallucination detection

**[01:15]** In fact, our hallucination detection

**[01:15]** In fact, our hallucination detection model, also called HHM,

**[01:18]** model, also called HHM,

**[01:18]** model, also called HHM, has just passed 5 mill downloads about

**[01:21]** has just passed 5 mill downloads about

**[01:21]** has just passed 5 mill downloads about couple months ago. I think it's at 5.5

**[01:23]** couple months ago. I think it's at 5.5

**[01:23]** couple months ago. I think it's at 5.5 right now or something like that. And

**[01:25]** right now or something like that. And

**[01:25]** right now or something like that. And generally our our operating system

**[01:28]** generally our our operating system

**[01:28]** generally our our operating system platform is what you would need for

**[01:30]** platform is what you would need for

**[01:30]** platform is what you would need for enterprisegrade deployment. So security,

**[01:33]** enterprisegrade deployment. So security,

**[01:33]** enterprisegrade deployment. So security, role- based access controls, bring your

**[01:35]** role- based access controls, bring your

**[01:35]** role- based access controls, bring your own model, custom prompts,

**[01:37]** own model, custom prompts,

**[01:37]** own model, custom prompts, observability, monitoring, everything

**[01:39]** observability, monitoring, everything

**[01:39]** observability, monitoring, everything you would need.

**[01:41]** you would need.

**[01:41]** you would need. So

**[01:42]** So

**[01:42]** So why does this matter? Well, in any

**[01:45]** why does this matter? Well, in any

**[01:45]** why does this matter? Well, in any generative AI application, an enterprise

**[01:47]** generative AI application, an enterprise

**[01:47]** generative AI application, an enterprise deep research is no different.

**[01:49]** deep research is no different.

**[01:49]** deep research is no different. Hallucinations are still a problem and

**[01:51]** Hallucinations are still a problem and

**[01:51]** Hallucinations are still a problem and you want to base your applications on

**[01:54]** you want to base your applications on

**[01:54]** you want to base your applications on really robust information. In fact, this

**[01:58]** really robust information. In fact, this

**[01:58]** really robust information. In fact, this is a statistics that shows that about


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** is a statistics that shows that about

**[02:00]** is a statistics that shows that about 73% of LM customers implementing use

**[02:05]** 73% of LM customers implementing use

**[02:05]** 73% of LM customers implementing use cases say that factual accuracy is their

**[02:07]** cases say that factual accuracy is their

**[02:07]** cases say that factual accuracy is their top challenge right now. So that's why

**[02:09]** top challenge right now. So that's why

**[02:09]** top challenge right now. So that's why we spend so much time in hallucination

**[02:11]** we spend so much time in hallucination

**[02:11]** we spend so much time in hallucination mitigation which enables enterprise deep

**[02:14]** mitigation which enables enterprise deep

**[02:14]** mitigation which enables enterprise deep research at really high quality.

**[02:17]** research at really high quality.

**[02:17]** research at really high quality. Okay, so with that in mind, let me jump

**[02:19]** Okay, so with that in mind, let me jump

**[02:19]** Okay, so with that in mind, let me jump into what is deep research. Deep

**[02:21]** into what is deep research. Deep

**[02:21]** into what is deep research. Deep research itself is something many of you

**[02:23]** research itself is something many of you

**[02:23]** research itself is something many of you probably know already. It's when an AI

**[02:25]** probably know already. It's when an AI

**[02:25]** probably know already. It's when an AI agent conducts indepth multi-step

**[02:28]** agent conducts indepth multi-step

**[02:28]** agent conducts indepth multi-step investigation,

**[02:30]** investigation,

**[02:30]** investigation, usually by autonomously browsing or

**[02:33]** usually by autonomously browsing or

**[02:33]** usually by autonomously browsing or searching the web in some way, getting

**[02:35]** searching the web in some way, getting

**[02:35]** searching the web in some way, getting results, synthesizing all these results

**[02:38]** results, synthesizing all these results

**[02:38]** results, synthesizing all these results together to generate a comprehensive

**[02:40]** together to generate a comprehensive

**[02:40]** together to generate a comprehensive report for you with citations and all

**[02:42]** report for you with citations and all

**[02:42]** report for you with citations and all the information you need to answer a

**[02:44]** the information you need to answer a

**[02:44]** the information you need to answer a particular question. Many have

**[02:46]** particular question. Many have

**[02:46]** particular question. Many have implemented this sort of web- based deep

**[02:48]** implemented this sort of web- based deep

**[02:48]** implemented this sort of web- based deep research. Gemini or Google has that chat

**[02:51]** research. Gemini or Google has that chat

**[02:51]** research. Gemini or Google has that chat GPT anthropic perplexity etc. Here's an

**[02:55]** GPT anthropic perplexity etc. Here's an

**[02:55]** GPT anthropic perplexity etc. Here's an example what it looks like. If you

**[02:56]** example what it looks like. If you

**[02:56]** example what it looks like. If you haven't used it, I highly encourage you

**[02:57]** haven't used it, I highly encourage you

**[02:57]** haven't used it, I highly encourage you to use it. It's a very powerful tool.

**[02:59]** to use it. It's a very powerful tool.

**[02:59]** to use it. It's a very powerful tool. And I use this all the time. This is the


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** And I use this all the time. This is the

**[03:01]** And I use this all the time. This is the screenshot of how you choose it in

**[03:03]** screenshot of how you choose it in

**[03:03]** screenshot of how you choose it in Gemini, for example. And here's how you

**[03:04]** Gemini, for example. And here's how you

**[03:04]** Gemini, for example. And here's how you choose it in Chat GPT. And this is

**[03:07]** choose it in Chat GPT. And this is

**[03:07]** choose it in Chat GPT. And this is usually something that takes about, you

**[03:08]** usually something that takes about, you

**[03:08]** usually something that takes about, you know, 20 30 minutes to complete because

**[03:10]** know, 20 30 minutes to complete because

**[03:10]** know, 20 30 minutes to complete because it does a lot of work underneath the

**[03:12]** it does a lot of work underneath the

**[03:12]** it does a lot of work underneath the covers.

**[03:14]** covers.

**[03:14]** covers. Now, enterprise deep research, think

**[03:16]** Now, enterprise deep research, think

**[03:16]** Now, enterprise deep research, think about it as exactly the same idea only

**[03:19]** about it as exactly the same idea only

**[03:19]** about it as exactly the same idea only now it goes to your private data. So

**[03:22]** now it goes to your private data. So

**[03:22]** now it goes to your private data. So again the same process multi- aent with

**[03:25]** again the same process multi- aent with

**[03:25]** again the same process multi- aent with reflection with synthesis of the final

**[03:28]** reflection with synthesis of the final

**[03:28]** reflection with synthesis of the final results parallel execution of of agents

**[03:30]** results parallel execution of of agents

**[03:30]** results parallel execution of of agents underneath and it queries your

**[03:32]** underneath and it queries your

**[03:32]** underneath and it queries your enterprise data of course using in this

**[03:34]** enterprise data of course using in this

**[03:34]** enterprise data of course using in this case victarogentic rank capabilities

**[03:37]** case victarogentic rank capabilities

**[03:37]** case victarogentic rank capabilities with all the bells and whistles of high

**[03:39]** with all the bells and whistles of high

**[03:39]** with all the bells and whistles of high accuracy and hallucination mitigation

**[03:42]** accuracy and hallucination mitigation

**[03:42]** accuracy and hallucination mitigation and then we have corpus understanding

**[03:44]** and then we have corpus understanding

**[03:44]** and then we have corpus understanding which allows you to plan properly based

**[03:46]** which allows you to plan properly based

**[03:46]** which allows you to plan properly based on your data.

**[03:49]** on your data.

**[03:49]** on your data. There are many really amazing use cases

**[03:51]** There are many really amazing use cases

**[03:51]** There are many really amazing use cases for this and I'm going to just mention a

**[03:53]** for this and I'm going to just mention a

**[03:53]** for this and I'm going to just mention a few here that I like. One is responding

**[03:56]** few here that I like. One is responding

**[03:56]** few here that I like. One is responding to an RFP. I've had this in my career

**[03:59]** to an RFP. I've had this in my career

**[03:59]** to an RFP. I've had this in my career multiple times when you have to respond


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** multiple times when you have to respond

**[04:00]** multiple times when you have to respond to an RFP and getting the answers to 150

**[04:04]** to an RFP and getting the answers to 150

**[04:04]** to an RFP and getting the answers to 150 questions is really difficult. So having

**[04:07]** questions is really difficult. So having

**[04:07]** questions is really difficult. So having being able to use enterprise deep
