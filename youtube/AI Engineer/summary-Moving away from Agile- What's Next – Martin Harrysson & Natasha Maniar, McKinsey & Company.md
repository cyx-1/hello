## Executive Summary

McKinsey consultants Martin Harrysson and Natasha Maniar present research on how AI is forcing a paradigm shift in software development, moving beyond traditional Agile methodologies. Based on a survey of 300 enterprises, they reveal that while individual developers see dramatic AI productivity gains, most companies achieve only 5-15% overall improvements due to bottlenecks in team collaboration, code review, and workflow allocation. Top-performing organizations overcome this by implementing "AI-native" workflows with smaller teams (3-5 people vs 8-10), spec-driven development instead of story-driven, continuous planning instead of quarterly sprints, and consolidated roles where engineers orchestrate agents. Success requires comprehensive change management including hands-on upskilling, measurement systems, and incentive structures. The talk provides concrete case studies showing 51% increases in code mergers and 60x increases in agent adoption when these organizational changes are implemented properly.

## Main Topics

### 1. **Introduction: AI as the New Paradigm Shift**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=22s)

- Martin and Natasha introduce McKinsey's Software X practice focused on AI-assisted software development
- Drawing parallel to Agile adoption 20 years ago, AI represents another major paradigm shift in how software is developed
- Focus is on people and operating model changes required, not just technology

### 2. **The Productivity Paradox: Individual Gains vs Organizational Reality**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=130s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=130s)

- Individual developers report tasks that took days/hours now take minutes with AI agents
- Despite these gains, McKinsey survey of 300 enterprises shows most companies only see 5-15% overall productivity improvement
- **Key insight**: Disconnect between individual productivity and team/organizational outcomes

### 3. **New Bottlenecks Created by AI Adoption**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=225s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=225s)

- **Work allocation challenges**: High variability in AI effectiveness across tasks and people makes resource allocation complex
- **Code review bottleneck**: Generating more code but still reviewing manually creates new constraint
- **Tech debt amplification**: Carnegie Mellon research shows AI-generated code can amplify technical debt and complexity
- **Collaboration lag**: Team collaboration processes haven't adapted to faster development pace

### 4. **Survey Findings: What Sets Top Performers Apart**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=516s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=516s)

Top performers are:
- **7x more likely** to have AI-native workflows (4+ use cases across SDLC, not point solutions)
- **6x more likely** to have AI-native roles (smaller pods with different skill sets)
- Invest in continuous hands-on upskilling, impact measurement, and incentive structures
- **Results**: 5-6x increase in time-to-market and delivery speed, plus higher quality artifacts

### 5. **AI-Native Workflows: Different Models for Different Work**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=456s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=456s)

Not one-size-fits-all; different engineering functions need different operating models:

- **Legacy code modernization**: "Factory of agents" model - high context, well-defined outputs, minimal human intervention
- **Green/brownfield new features**: Iterative loop model - agents as co-creators providing options for faster feedback
- **Key shifts**: Quarterly → continuous planning; story-driven → spec-driven development

### 6. **AI-Native Roles: From Two-Pizza to One-Pizza Teams**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=597s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=597s)

- Team size: 8-10 people → 3-5 people pods
- **Consolidated roles**: Instead of separate QA, frontend, backend engineers
- **Product builders**: Manage/orchestrate agents with full-stack fluency and understanding of entire architecture
- **PMs**: Create prototypes directly in code instead of iterating on long PRDs
- Example: Cursor's internal operating model highlighted as AI-native startup approach

### 7. **Case Study: International Bank Team-Level Interventions**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=649s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=649s)

Specific interventions to address bottlenecks:
- Team leads assign sprint stories using agents based on velocity/delivery history data
- Co-create multiple prototypes and iterate with agents on acceptance criteria for security/observability
- Reorganize squads by workflow type (bug fixes vs greenfield development)
- Background agents analyze cross-repository impacts to prevent debugging time
- PMs observe real-time customer feedback instead of waiting for data scientist input

**Results**: 60x increase in agent consumption, 51% increase in code mergers, tied directly to business priorities

### 8. **The Talent Model Shift: Engineers as Orchestrators**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=780s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=780s)

- Engineers moving from execution/writing code → orchestrators dividing work to agents
- Product managers role evolving significantly
- **Critical gap**: 70% of surveyed companies haven't changed role definitions despite expecting different behavior
- Same role expectations from 2+ years ago no longer fit AI-augmented reality

### 9. **Case Study: Smaller Pods, Same Performance**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=843s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=843s)

- Client example: Traditional two-pizza team model → much smaller pods with consolidated roles
- Created more teams with same number of people
- Maintained or improved code quality while significantly increasing output speed
- Each pod performs at same level as larger traditional teams

### 10. **Scaling Across Organizations: The Change Management Challenge**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=919s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=919s)

- For enterprises with hundreds of teams and thousands of developers, change management is key differentiator
- Success requires getting 20-30+ things right simultaneously:
  - Communication strategy
  - Incentive structures
  - Upskilling programs
  - Measurement systems

### 11. **Case Study: Failed Then Successful Rollout at Tech Company**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=983s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=983s)

Initial rollout:
- Tools deployed but usage dropped off or used suboptimally
- Despite adding users, overall impact didn't change

Reset approach:
- Clarified day-to-day expectations for developers and PMs
- **Hands-on upskilling**: "Bring your own code" sessions, coaches available during first sprints
- Critical support during habit formation period when developers integrate AI into daily workflow
- Implemented measurement system to track what's improving
- **Result**: Sustained adoption and impact

### 12. **Key Interventions for Successful Change**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1074s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1074s)

Top interventions from successful client:
- Setting up code labs for hands-on practice
- New certification programs to motivate and drive behavioral change
- Each intervention individually may seem minor, but collectively create significant impact

### 13. **Building Robust Measurement Systems**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1111s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1111s)

**Surprising finding**: Bottom performers weren't measuring speed at all; only 10% measured productivity

**MECI Framework** (Inputs → Outputs → Outcomes → Economic Impact):

- **Inputs**: Investment in coding tools, AI tools, upskilling time/resources, change management
- **Outputs**:
  - Breadth/depth of AI adoption → increased velocity/capacity
  - Developer NPS scores and craft enjoyment (not frustration)
  - Code security, quality, resilience (proxy: mean time to resolve priority bugs)
- **Economic Outcomes** (C-suite priorities):
  - Time to revenue target
  - Price differential for higher quality features
  - Customer expansion to meet feature demand
  - Cost reduction per pod from reduced human labor
  - Reinvestment in green/brownfield development

### 14. **Vision for the Future**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1234s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1234s)

Future software development model (even as agents get smarter and humans more AI-fluent):
- **Shorter sprints** (not two-week cycles)
- **Smaller teams** (one-pizza vs two-pizza)
- **Larger number of teams** overall
- Spec-driven vs story-driven development
- Continuous vs quarterly planning

### 15. **Key Takeaways**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1266s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZStlIhyTCY&t=1266s)

- **Start now**: This is a human change that takes time - it's a journey
- **Find your model**: Determine which operating model works for your organization
- **Set bold ambition**: Don't settle for marginal 5-15% gains when 5-6x improvements are possible
- McKinsey has published research article with detailed findings
