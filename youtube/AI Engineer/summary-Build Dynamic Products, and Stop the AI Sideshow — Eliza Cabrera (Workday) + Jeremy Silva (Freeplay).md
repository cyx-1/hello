## Executive Summary

Eliza Cabrera (Principal AI Product Manager at Workday) and Jeremy Silva (Product Lead at Freeplay) argue that companies should "stop the AI sideshow" by integrating AI deeply into their product strategy rather than treating it as a separate initiative. They present a "crawl, walk, run" framework for building dynamic AI products that solve real customer problems instead of just demonstrating AI capability. The talk uses Workday's journey—from content generation features to an autonomous agent system—as a case study for building embedded, contextually aware AI experiences that feel like a natural part of the product rather than bolt-on features.

## Main Topics

### [Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=17s) (00:17)
- Eliza Cabrera introduces herself as Principal AI Product Manager at Workday, working on financial audit agent and policy agent
- Jeremy Silva shares his background building language models since pre-GPT3 era, now leading product at Freeplay
- Core message: Stop leading with AI in your product strategy

### [The Problem: AI Sideshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=67s) (01:07)
- Everyone at the AI conference is talking about agents and AI—it's becoming undifferentiated
- Leading with AI in go-to-market and product strategy was useful initially to signal being at the forefront
- Now everyone is saying the same thing, resulting in bolt-on, non-differentiated AI products
- The evolution: chat UIs → content generation → RAG/vector databases → co-pilots → agents

### [Root Causes of the AI Sideshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=238s) (03:58)
- **Centralized AI strategy running as sidecar:** Companies create separate AI initiatives instead of deeply integrating with core product strategy
- **Risk mitigation through quarantine:** Teams try to manage AI risk by isolating it to specific corners of the product
- **Technology over customer needs:** Teams become "the hammer in search of the nail"—building chatbots to demonstrate capability, not because customers struggle with support
- **Top-down solutions:** Pushing solutions from the top rather than enabling bottom-up discovery

### [How to Avoid the AI Sideshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=343s) (05:43)
- **Integrate AI risk into planning:** Build evaluation and testing systems rather than quarantining AI
- **Start with customer problems:** Don't invent new problems to solve with AI
- **Enable bottom-up discovery:** Let product teams who are boots on the ground experiment, prototype, and fail fast
- **Set top-level strategy:** Provide direction while allowing manifestation to come from the bottom up
- Good AI products don't announce themselves as "AI"—they just solve customer problems better

### [Crawl, Walk, Run Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=460s) (07:40)
- **Philosophy:** Build capability iteratively while laying the foundation throughout your product suite
- **Example:** Customer support SaaS company with shared inbox feature

**Crawl Phase** - [08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=503s)
- Build embedded AI experiences
- Not creating new product surface area
- Add AI on the backend to accentuate existing functionality
- Example: Semantic search to surface previous similar questions

**Walk Phase** - [08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=533s)
- Build contextual and personalized AI experiences
- Start creating new product surface area
- Not yet fundamentally rethinking core app architecture
- Example: AI-generated draft responses ready when user opens ticket

**Run Phase** - [09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=562s)
- Build dynamic, interoperable, integrated AI experiences throughout product suite
- Requires fundamentally rethinking UI, UX, and app architecture
- Example: Autonomous agent triaging issues and responding to customers across the entire product
- Each phase builds on the previous—not throwing out functionality

### [Workday Case Study: HR Service Delivery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=619s) (10:19)
- **Problem space:** Employee self-service and support case management
- Employees need quick answers to questions; otherwise they create support cases

**Crawl: Content Generation in Help Product** - [11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=660s)
- Knowledge base + case management solution
- **Content generation:** Upload policy docs (20+ pages), AI creates employee FAQs and manager talking points
- **Translations:** Translate into 34 languages with a few clicks, manage versions
- Design philosophy: Built for users who didn't know about Gen AI (2023)
- No "in your face sparkles and chatbots everywhere"—subtle purple sparkles for AI disclosure
- Human in the loop with appropriate disclaimers
- Went GA in August 2024 (R2)
- Target: Large enterprises with content teams of 3-15 people needing unified voice

**Walk: Workday Assistant (Contextual Co-pilot)** - [13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=817s)
- Manager doing location change to San Francisco
- Contextually aware co-pilot that lives across Workday
- Knows what's happening on the page, provides contextually aware suggestions
- **Data sensitivity escalation:** Help articles (customer content) vs. PII/compensation data
- Platform capability requiring cross-suite alignment (HCM, financials, benefits, procurement)
- Top-down and bottoms-up alignment required

**Run: Agent System of Record** - [15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=902s)
- Announced a few months prior to talk
- Agentic capabilities behind Workday Assistant
- Users don't need technical expertise about agents—it happens behind the scenes
- More autonomous and proactive: listening to policy changes, notifying with suggestions
- Threads the needle across different product experiences
- Scaled from single product within SKU to core platform serving 60% of S&P 500

### [The North Star: Dynamic Products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=975s) (16:15)
- AI and agents are stepping stones for teaching organizations how to build impactful AI experiences
- Goal: Build truly dynamic products, not just apply powerful technology to yesterday's roadmap
- **New problem spaces:** As we digitize new data and inputs, product problem spaces extend
- **Multimodal opportunities:** Frictionless multimodal experiences that interoperate
- Interoperability and RL still relevant in agent sphere
- Dynamic products responsive to your environment represent the next generation

### [Closing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-4NKDYnRs&t=1065s) (17:45)

- Session finished right on time at 20 minutes

## Key Takeaways

1. **Avoid the "AI sideshow":** Don't run AI as a separate strategy—deeply integrate it with core product planning
2. **Customer problems first:** Start with real customer pain points, not with showcasing AI capability
3. **Crawl, walk, run approach:** Build iteratively from embedded features → contextual experiences → dynamic integrated products
4. **Bottom-up discovery:** Let product teams experiment while setting top-level strategic direction
5. **Good AI products don't announce themselves:** The best AI integrations solve problems better without needing to shout "powered by AI"
6. **Think beyond today's roadmap:** Dynamic products should leverage new data and multimodal capabilities to tackle new problem spaces
7. **Build on what you have:** Each phase extends functionality rather than replacing it
