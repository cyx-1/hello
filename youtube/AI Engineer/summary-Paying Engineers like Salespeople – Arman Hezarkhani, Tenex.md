## Executive Summary

Arman Hezarkhani, co-founder of Tenex, presents an unconventional compensation model where engineers are paid based on story points they complete, similar to how salespeople are compensated. The talk explores the history of compensation models, why traditional salary + bonus + equity structures may not incentivize AI adoption, and how Tenex's performance-based model has enabled them to hire world-class talent, ship code rapidly, and maintain high quality. The presentation addresses common risks like story point inflation and quality concerns, explaining how Tenex mitigates these through dual roles, rigorous QA processes, and careful hiring.

## Main Topics

### [Introduction and Background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=0s)
- Arman introduces himself as co-founder of Tenex, a company helping businesses with AI transformation
- Key announcement: Tenex pays engineers like salespeople based on story points completed
- Initial skepticism from experienced engineers about this unconventional approach

### [The Motivation: WeWork Observation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=141s)
- Story of observing a fellow engineer typing code character-by-character while Arman used 45 AI agents
- The core insight: compensation models create different incentives
- Founder incentives (squeeze out every efficiency) vs. employee incentives (base + bonus + equity)
- Recognition that traditional compensation doesn't drive AI adoption

### [History of Compensation Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=270s)
- **Hourly pay**: Creates disincentive to work faster; workers benefit from taking longer
- **Fixed-price projects**: Engineers pad estimates to avoid downside risk
- **Salary + bonus**: People "punch in at nine, leave at five" without extra motivation
- **Equity**: Works for founders and successful companies, but most startups fail; engineers increasingly opt for cash over equity

### [The Case for Reinvention in the AI Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=445s)
- Traditional compensation models need updating for the AI era
- Need to directly incentivize using AI tools effectively while maintaining quality
- Argument that current models hold people back from adopting AI fully

### [How Tenex's Model Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=458s)
- Two types of work: roadmapping and execution
- Two client-facing roles:
  - **Strategists**: Former PMs/engineers doing consulting work, compensated based on NRR (customer happiness)
  - **AI Engineers**: Focus on architecture design documents and implementation
- Engineers create architecture design docs with ticketed tasks assigned story points
- Engineers paid a flat base plus quarterly bonuses based on completed story points
- Clients also pay based on story points delivered

### [Case Study #1: Billboard Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=569s)
- Client sells billboard inventory both traditionally and via online platform (like "Uber for billboards")
- Problem: Image moderation required two rounds (internal + billboard owner), causing delays and lost revenue
- Solution: AI moderation model achieving 96% accuracy compared to human moderators
- Delivered in two weeks

### [Case Study #2: Retail Analytics Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=653s)
- Client had low-power devices in retailers running single AI model for heat mapping
- Tenex analyzed potential for additional capabilities with more power/quantized models
- Built five models running in parallel: heat mapping, queue detection, theft detection, and more

### [Addressing the Risks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=722s)
**Risk #1: Story Point Inflation**
- Strategists (not engineers) scope the work and assign story points
- Multiple rounds of internal review required

**Risk #2: Rushing and Quality Drops**
- Tickets require approval from strategist, internal QA, and client
- Strategists compensated based on customer happiness (NRR), creating counterbalance to engineer incentives

**Risk #3: Sharp-Elbowed Sales Culture**
- Solution: "Make hiring incredibly difficult so everything else is easy"
- Focus on hiring people with the right attributes
- Key principle: "AI makes people look like one of those crazy mirrors - it makes attributes 10x larger"
- Great engineers become greater with AI; sloppy engineers become sloppier

### [Conclusion and Call to Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRekpZpBZs&t=850s)
- AI gives people superpowers but current compensation models hold them back
- Invitation to rethink how teams are compensated (not just engineering)
- Tenex has successfully hired world-class talent (ML researchers, NASA rocket scientists, exited founders)

## Key Insights

1. **Compensation drives behavior**: The core thesis is that compensation structure directly influences whether engineers adopt AI tools effectively

2. **Results achieved**: Despite skepticism, Tenex has:
   - Hired world-class engineers including ML researchers and NASA scientists
   - Shipped code rapidly while maintaining quality
   - Achieved 96% accuracy on AI moderation in 2 weeks

3. **Risk mitigation through structure**: The dual-role system (strategists vs. engineers) with opposing incentives creates natural checks and balances

4. **Hiring is the foundation**: The model only works with careful hiring - "AI amplifies existing attributes 10x"

5. **Historical context matters**: Understanding why previous compensation models evolved helps explain why a new approach is needed for the AI age
