**[00:23]** I'm so excited to tell you about how at

**[00:23]** I'm so excited to tell you about how at Zapier we are empowering our support

**[00:25]** Zapier we are empowering our support

**[00:25]** Zapier we are empowering our support team to ship code. Before I tell you

**[00:28]** team to ship code. Before I tell you

**[00:28]** team to ship code. Before I tell you about that, has anybody here visited the

**[00:31]** about that, has anybody here visited the

**[00:31]** about that, has anybody here visited the Grand Canyon?

**[00:33]** Grand Canyon?

**[00:33]** Grand Canyon? It's a good amount. Anybody rafted

**[00:35]** It's a good amount. Anybody rafted

**[00:35]** It's a good amount. Anybody rafted through the Grand Canyon?

**[00:38]** through the Grand Canyon?

**[00:38]** through the Grand Canyon? I see one person. I just got off an

**[00:41]** I see one person. I just got off an

**[00:41]** I see one person. I just got off an 18-day trip rafting through the Grand

**[00:43]** 18-day trip rafting through the Grand

**[00:43]** 18-day trip rafting through the Grand Canyon over 200 miles. It was

**[00:45]** Canyon over 200 miles. It was

**[00:45]** Canyon over 200 miles. It was incredible. No internet, no cell

**[00:48]** incredible. No internet, no cell

**[00:48]** incredible. No internet, no cell service. The moment I got off, I found

**[00:50]** service. The moment I got off, I found

**[00:50]** service. The moment I got off, I found out I was giving this talk. I didn't

**[00:53]** out I was giving this talk. I didn't

**[00:53]** out I was giving this talk. I didn't think about uh work at all on the river,

**[00:56]** think about uh work at all on the river,

**[00:56]** think about uh work at all on the river, but once I got off, I started thinking

**[00:58]** but once I got off, I started thinking

**[00:58]** but once I got off, I started thinking about the parallels between the Grand


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** about the parallels between the Grand

**[01:00]** about the parallels between the Grand Canyon and Zapier. And we have one thing

**[01:03]** Canyon and Zapier. And we have one thing

**[01:03]** Canyon and Zapier. And we have one thing in common, and that is erosion.

**[01:07]** in common, and that is erosion.

**[01:07]** in common, and that is erosion. Now, natural erosion happens over

**[01:09]** Now, natural erosion happens over

**[01:09]** Now, natural erosion happens over millions of years with wind, water, and

**[01:12]** millions of years with wind, water, and

**[01:12]** millions of years with wind, water, and time. It creates the beautiful canyon

**[01:15]** time. It creates the beautiful canyon

**[01:15]** time. It creates the beautiful canyon that we experience, and it's never

**[01:19]** that we experience, and it's never

**[01:19]** that we experience, and it's never stopping, always continuing. At Zapier,

**[01:21]** stopping, always continuing. At Zapier,

**[01:22]** stopping, always continuing. At Zapier, we have over 8,000 integrations built on

**[01:24]** we have over 8,000 integrations built on

**[01:24]** we have over 8,000 integrations built on thirdparty APIs, and they are constantly

**[01:27]** thirdparty APIs, and they are constantly

**[01:27]** thirdparty APIs, and they are constantly changing, which I'm now thinking of as

**[01:30]** changing, which I'm now thinking of as

**[01:30]** changing, which I'm now thinking of as app erosion.

**[01:32]** app erosion.

**[01:32]** app erosion. We've been around for 14 years. Some of

**[01:34]** We've been around for 14 years. Some of

**[01:34]** We've been around for 14 years. Some of our apps are that old. API changes and

**[01:36]** our apps are that old. API changes and

**[01:36]** our apps are that old. API changes and deprecations impact us and create

**[01:40]** deprecations impact us and create

**[01:40]** deprecations impact us and create reliability issues. Again, it never

**[01:43]** reliability issues. Again, it never

**[01:43]** reliability issues. Again, it never stops.

**[01:44]** stops.

**[01:44]** stops. So, I like to think of our apps as like

**[01:47]** So, I like to think of our apps as like

**[01:47]** So, I like to think of our apps as like layers in the Grand Canyon and they need

**[01:50]** layers in the Grand Canyon and they need

**[01:50]** layers in the Grand Canyon and they need constant attention.

**[01:52]** constant attention.

**[01:52]** constant attention. So, if we were to create our own Zap

**[01:55]** So, if we were to create our own Zap

**[01:55]** So, if we were to create our own Zap Your Canyon and our apps would be at the

**[01:57]** Your Canyon and our apps would be at the

**[01:57]** Your Canyon and our apps would be at the walls, here's our support team flowing


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** walls, here's our support team flowing

**[02:00]** walls, here's our support team flowing down the middle watching out for app

**[02:03]** down the middle watching out for app

**[02:03]** down the middle watching out for app erosion. And we have a backlog crisis.

**[02:07]** erosion. And we have a backlog crisis.

**[02:07]** erosion. And we have a backlog crisis. Tickets were coming in faster than we

**[02:09]** Tickets were coming in faster than we

**[02:09]** Tickets were coming in faster than we could handle them. creates integration

**[02:12]** could handle them. creates integration

**[02:12]** could handle them. creates integration reliability issues, poor customer

**[02:15]** reliability issues, poor customer

**[02:15]** reliability issues, poor customer experience, even churn. So to solve for

**[02:18]** experience, even churn. So to solve for

**[02:18]** experience, even churn. So to solve for app erosion, we kicked off two parallel

**[02:20]** app erosion, we kicked off two parallel

**[02:20]** app erosion, we kicked off two parallel experiments. The first was moving

**[02:24]** experiments. The first was moving

**[02:24]** experiments. The first was moving support from just triaging to also

**[02:27]** support from just triaging to also

**[02:27]** support from just triaging to also fixing these bugs. This experiment

**[02:29]** fixing these bugs. This experiment

**[02:29]** fixing these bugs. This experiment number one and experiment number two, we

**[02:32]** number one and experiment number two, we

**[02:32]** number one and experiment number two, we were asking, can AI help solve app

**[02:35]** were asking, can AI help solve app

**[02:35]** were asking, can AI help solve app erosion faster?

**[02:37]** erosion faster?

**[02:37]** erosion faster? So let's jump into experiment one. This

**[02:40]** So let's jump into experiment one. This

**[02:40]** So let's jump into experiment one. This get kicked off two years ago but had to

**[02:42]** get kicked off two years ago but had to

**[02:42]** get kicked off two years ago but had to start with the why. We needed to get

**[02:44]** start with the why. We needed to get

**[02:44]** start with the why. We needed to get that buy in to empower our support team

**[02:46]** that buy in to empower our support team

**[02:46]** that buy in to empower our support team to ship code.

**[02:49]** to ship code.

**[02:49]** to ship code. So app erosion is one of the major

**[02:52]** So app erosion is one of the major

**[02:52]** So app erosion is one of the major sources of bugs coming through to from

**[02:55]** sources of bugs coming through to from

**[02:55]** sources of bugs coming through to from support to engineering. So there's a big

**[02:58]** support to engineering. So there's a big

**[02:58]** support to engineering. So there's a big need support is eager for this


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:02]** need support is eager for this

**[03:02]** need support is eager for this experience to a lot of them want to go

**[03:04]** experience to a lot of them want to go

**[03:04]** experience to a lot of them want to go into engineering eventually and

**[03:05]** into engineering eventually and

**[03:05]** into engineering eventually and unofficially many support members were

**[03:08]** unofficially many support members were

**[03:08]** unofficially many support members were already helping to maintain our apps.

**[03:11]** already helping to maintain our apps.

**[03:11]** already helping to maintain our apps. This moves us into how we started this

**[03:13]** This moves us into how we started this

**[03:14]** This moves us into how we started this out. Put on some guard rails. We started

**[03:17]** out. Put on some guard rails. We started

**[03:17]** out. Put on some guard rails. We started with just four target apps to uh focus

**[03:20]** with just four target apps to uh focus

**[03:20]** with just four target apps to uh focus our fixes on. engineering was set to

**[03:23]** our fixes on. engineering was set to

**[03:23]** our fixes on. engineering was set to review any merge requests coming from

**[03:25]** review any merge requests coming from

**[03:25]** review any merge requests coming from support and we kept the focus on app

**[03:27]** support and we kept the focus on app

**[03:27]** support and we kept the focus on app fixes.

**[03:29]** fixes.

**[03:29]** fixes. So jumping into experiment two, this is

**[03:31]** So jumping into experiment two, this is

**[03:31]** So jumping into experiment two, this is what I've been leading for the last

**[03:32]** what I've been leading for the last

**[03:32]** what I've been leading for the last couple of years. How can we use codegen

**[03:35]** couple of years. How can we use codegen

**[03:35]** couple of years. How can we use codegen to help solve for app erosion and so

**[03:37]** to help solve for app erosion and so

**[03:38]** to help solve for app erosion and so fortuitously the name of this project is

**[03:41]** fortuitously the name of this project is

**[03:41]** fortuitously the name of this project is scout which ties in so well to the Grand

**[03:44]** scout which ties in so well to the Grand

**[03:44]** scout which ties in so well to the Grand Canyon experience that I've just been

**[03:45]** Canyon experience that I've just been

**[03:45]** Canyon experience that I've just been through.

**[03:47]** through.

**[03:48]** through. As any good product manager, we start

**[03:50]** As any good product manager, we start

**[03:50]** As any good product manager, we start with discovery. We did some dog fooding,

**[03:53]** with discovery. We did some dog fooding,

**[03:53]** with discovery. We did some dog fooding, so I shipped some app fixes. Uh we

**[03:56]** so I shipped some app fixes. Uh we

**[03:56]** so I shipped some app fixes. Uh we shadowed engineers and support team

**[03:58]** shadowed engineers and support team

**[03:58]** shadowed engineers and support team members as they were going through the


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** members as they were going through the

**[04:00]** members as they were going through the app fix process. We designed out uh what

**[04:04]** app fix process. We designed out uh what

**[04:04]** app fix process. We designed out uh what are the pain points experienced along

**[04:05]** are the pain points experienced along

**[04:05]** are the pain points experienced along the way? What are the phases of the work

**[04:08]** the way? What are the phases of the work

**[04:08]** the way? What are the phases of the work and how much time is spent?

**[04:11]** and how much time is spent?

**[04:11]** and how much time is spent? One big discovery we had is how much

**[04:14]** One big discovery we had is how much

**[04:14]** One big discovery we had is how much time is spent gathering the context

**[04:17]** time is spent gathering the context

**[04:17]** time is spent gathering the context going to the thirdparty AP API docs even

**[04:20]** going to the thirdparty AP API docs even

**[04:20]** going to the thirdparty AP API docs even crawling the internet looking for

**[04:23]** crawling the internet looking for

**[04:23]** crawling the internet looking for information about a bug that's emerging

**[04:24]** information about a bug that's emerging

**[04:24]** information about a bug that's emerging maybe somebody else has already

**[04:26]** maybe somebody else has already

**[04:26]** maybe somebody else has already discovered and solved for it outside of

**[04:27]** discovered and solved for it outside of

**[04:27]** discovered and solved for it outside of Zapier internal context logs all of this

**[04:32]** Zapier internal context logs all of this

**[04:32]** Zapier internal context logs all of this is a lot of context to go and search for

**[04:35]** is a lot of context to go and search for

**[04:35]** is a lot of context to go and search for as a human uh and a lot to gro and work

**[04:39]** as a human uh and a lot to gro and work

**[04:40]** as a human uh and a lot to gro and work through. This is something we knew we

**[04:42]** through. This is something we knew we

**[04:42]** through. This is something we knew we needed to solve for.

**[04:45]** needed to solve for.

**[04:45]** needed to solve for. Where we started with all this great uh

**[04:50]** Where we started with all this great uh

**[04:50]** Where we started with all this great uh opportunities and pain points is we

**[04:53]** opportunities and pain points is we

**[04:53]** opportunities and pain points is we started building APIs that we believed

**[04:56]** started building APIs that we believed

**[04:56]** started building APIs that we believed would solve for these individual um pain

**[04:59]** would solve for these individual um pain

**[04:59]** would solve for these individual um pain points. And some of these APIs are using


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:03]** points. And some of these APIs are using

**[05:03]** points. And some of these APIs are using LLMs to you know for our diagnosis tool

**[05:08]** LLMs to you know for our diagnosis tool

**[05:08]** LLMs to you know for our diagnosis tool gathering all that context on behalf of

**[05:10]** gathering all that context on behalf of

**[05:10]** gathering all that context on behalf of the uh support person engineer and

**[05:13]** the uh support person engineer and

**[05:13]** the uh support person engineer and curating that context and building a

**[05:15]** curating that context and building a

**[05:15]** curating that context and building a diagnosis that's [clears throat] using

**[05:17]** diagnosis that's [clears throat] using

**[05:17]** diagnosis that's [clears throat] using an LLM and then some aren't like we have

**[05:20]** an LLM and then some aren't like we have

**[05:20]** an LLM and then some aren't like we have a unit test uh unit test generator is

**[05:23]** a unit test uh unit test generator is

**[05:23]** a unit test uh unit test generator is but the um test case finder is simply

**[05:27]** but the um test case finder is simply

**[05:27]** but the um test case finder is simply using a search query to look for the

**[05:29]** using a search query to look for the

**[05:29]** using a search query to look for the right test cases to pull in for your

**[05:31]** right test cases to pull in for your

**[05:31]** right test cases to pull in for your unit test. We built a bunch of APIs. We

**[05:35]** unit test. We built a bunch of APIs. We

**[05:35]** unit test. We built a bunch of APIs. We had a bunch of great ideas. So there was

**[05:37]** had a bunch of great ideas. So there was

**[05:37]** had a bunch of great ideas. So there was a lot for us to test with, but we ran

**[05:39]** a lot for us to test with, but we ran

**[05:40]** a lot for us to test with, but we ran into some challenges in this first

**[05:41]** into some challenges in this first

**[05:41]** into some challenges in this first phase. We had APIs, but they were not

**[05:44]** phase. We had APIs, but they were not

**[05:44]** phase. We had APIs, but they were not embedded into our engineers process. So

**[05:47]** embedded into our engineers process. So

**[05:47]** embedded into our engineers process. So our tool I just said they don't like to

**[05:50]** our tool I just said they don't like to

**[05:50]** our tool I just said they don't like to go to so many web pages to find all

**[05:53]** go to so many web pages to find all

**[05:53]** go to so many web pages to find all their context. They would love all this

**[05:55]** their context. They would love all this

**[05:55]** their context. They would love all this information to come to them. And yet our

**[05:57]** information to come to them. And yet our

**[05:57]** information to come to them. And yet our web interface where we've we've created

**[05:59]** web interface where we've we've created

**[05:59]** web interface where we've we've created a playground we call autocode internally


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:02]** a playground we call autocode internally

**[06:02]** a playground we call autocode internally where you can come and play around with

**[06:04]** where you can come and play around with

**[06:04]** where you can come and play around with our APIs and our ask to the teams was

**[06:08]** our APIs and our ask to the teams was

**[06:08]** our APIs and our ask to the teams was come try out our APIs and give us

**[06:11]** come try out our APIs and give us

**[06:11]** come try out our APIs and give us feedback.

**[06:13]** feedback.

**[06:13]** feedback. Now this is just one more window to go

**[06:15]** Now this is just one more window to go

**[06:15]** Now this is just one more window to go to. So we didn't get a lot of engagement

**[06:18]** to. So we didn't get a lot of engagement

**[06:18]** to. So we didn't get a lot of engagement also because we had shipped so many uh

**[06:21]** also because we had shipped so many uh

**[06:21]** also because we had shipped so many uh APIs our team was spread pretty thin.

**[06:25]** APIs our team was spread pretty thin.

**[06:25]** APIs our team was spread pretty thin. Cursor launched at the same time which

**[06:27]** Cursor launched at the same time which

**[06:27]** Cursor launched at the same time which has gotten great adoption at Zapier.

**[06:29]** has gotten great adoption at Zapier.

**[06:29]** has gotten great adoption at Zapier. We're all huge fans of Cursor. But from

**[06:32]** We're all huge fans of Cursor. But from

**[06:32]** We're all huge fans of Cursor. But from our side, it made some of our tools no

**[06:34]** our side, it made some of our tools no

**[06:34]** our side, it made some of our tools no longer necessary.

**[06:36]** longer necessary.

**[06:36]** longer necessary. But there was one major win in this

**[06:38]** But there was one major win in this

**[06:38]** But there was one major win in this phase, which is one of our APIs became a

**[06:41]** phase, which is one of our APIs became a

**[06:41]** phase, which is one of our APIs became a support darling. It's diagnosis. That

**[06:44]** support darling. It's diagnosis. That

**[06:44]** support darling. It's diagnosis. That number one pain point of needing to go

**[06:46]** number one pain point of needing to go

**[06:46]** number one pain point of needing to go out and find all of your context, curate

**[06:48]** out and find all of your context, curate

**[06:48]** out and find all of your context, curate it for yourself so you can start solving

**[06:50]** it for yourself so you can start solving

**[06:50]** it for yourself so you can start solving the problem. We were doing that on uh

**[06:53]** the problem. We were doing that on uh

**[06:54]** the problem. We were doing that on uh the sport team's behalf with the

**[06:56]** the sport team's behalf with the

**[06:56]** the sport team's behalf with the diagnosis API

**[06:59]** diagnosis API

**[06:59]** diagnosis API and support loved it enough that they


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** and support loved it enough that they

**[07:02]** and support loved it enough that they decided to embed it into their process.

**[07:05]** decided to embed it into their process.

**[07:05]** decided to embed it into their process. They asked us to build a zap year

**[07:06]** They asked us to build a zap year

**[07:06]** They asked us to build a zap year integration on our autocode APIs so they

**[07:09]** integration on our autocode APIs so they

**[07:09]** integration on our autocode APIs so they could embed it into their zap that

**[07:12]** could embed it into their zap that

**[07:12]** could embed it into their zap that creates the jur ticket from the support

**[07:14]** creates the jur ticket from the support

**[07:14]** creates the jur ticket from the support issue and now diagnosis is included.

**[07:19]** issue and now diagnosis is included.

**[07:19]** issue and now diagnosis is included. So embedding tools is the key to usage

**[07:22]** So embedding tools is the key to usage

**[07:22]** So embedding tools is the key to usage as we find out. So how can we embed more

**[07:24]** as we find out. So how can we embed more

**[07:24]** as we find out. So how can we embed more of our tools? Well, then MCP spins up

**[07:28]** of our tools? Well, then MCP spins up

**[07:28]** of our tools? Well, then MCP spins up and that solves our problem.

**[07:31]** and that solves our problem.

**[07:31]** and that solves our problem. We can now embed these API tools into

**[07:36]** We can now embed these API tools into

**[07:36]** We can now embed these API tools into our engineers workflow. Specifically,

**[07:38]** our engineers workflow. Specifically,

**[07:38]** our engineers workflow. Specifically, our engineers are pulling in these MCP

**[07:41]** our engineers are pulling in these MCP

**[07:41]** our engineers are pulling in these MCP tools as they're using cursor.

**[07:44]** tools as they're using cursor.

**[07:44]** tools as they're using cursor. Our builders using Scout MCP tools are

**[07:48]** Our builders using Scout MCP tools are

**[07:48]** Our builders using Scout MCP tools are leaving the IDE less, spending more time

**[07:51]** leaving the IDE less, spending more time

**[07:51]** leaving the IDE less, spending more time in one window.

**[07:53]** in one window.

**[07:53]** in one window. Still coming into challenges. One of our

**[07:57]** Still coming into challenges. One of our

**[07:57]** Still coming into challenges. One of our uh our our key tool diagnosis

**[07:59]** uh our our key tool diagnosis

**[07:59]** uh our our key tool diagnosis uh is so valuable to pull all that


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:02]** uh is so valuable to pull all that

**[08:02]** uh is so valuable to pull all that context and to provide a recommendation,

**[08:05]** context and to provide a recommendation,

**[08:05]** context and to provide a recommendation, but it takes a long time to run. Now, we

**[08:08]** but it takes a long time to run. Now, we

**[08:08]** but it takes a long time to run. Now, we might run down that runtime. However, as

**[08:11]** might run down that runtime. However, as

**[08:11]** might run down that runtime. However, as you're working synchronously on a ticket

**[08:13]** you're working synchronously on a ticket

**[08:13]** you're working synchronously on a ticket in your ID, this was frustrating. We

**[08:15]** in your ID, this was frustrating. We

**[08:15]** in your ID, this was frustrating. We also weren't keeping up with the

**[08:17]** also weren't keeping up with the

**[08:17]** also weren't keeping up with the customization needs. Not only did MCP

**[08:20]** customization needs. Not only did MCP

**[08:20]** customization needs. Not only did MCP launch and we started leveraging it, Zap

**[08:22]** launch and we started leveraging it, Zap

**[08:22]** launch and we started leveraging it, Zap Your MCP launched too. And some of our

**[08:24]** Your MCP launched too. And some of our

**[08:24]** Your MCP launched too. And some of our tools, if we weren't keeping up with the

**[08:26]** tools, if we weren't keeping up with the

**[08:26]** tools, if we weren't keeping up with the customization needs, our engineers

**[08:29]** customization needs, our engineers

**[08:29]** customization needs, our engineers internally looked to Zap Your MCP, which

**[08:32]** internally looked to Zap Your MCP, which

**[08:32]** internally looked to Zap Your MCP, which is great. We're all on the same team

**[08:34]** is great. We're all on the same team

**[08:34]** is great. We're all on the same team solving the same problem, but some of

**[08:36]** solving the same problem, but some of

**[08:36]** solving the same problem, but some of our tools had a dead end. Also adoption

**[08:39]** our tools had a dead end. Also adoption

**[08:40]** our tools had a dead end. Also adoption was scattered. We had a whole suite of

**[08:42]** was scattered. We had a whole suite of

**[08:42]** was scattered. We had a whole suite of tools and we thought there was value in

**[08:43]** tools and we thought there was value in

**[08:43]** tools and we thought there was value in each of them as it solves for different

**[08:45]** each of them as it solves for different

**[08:45]** each of them as it solves for different problems across the different stages.

**[08:49]** problems across the different stages.

**[08:49]** problems across the different stages. Not every engineer was using our tools

**[08:51]** Not every engineer was using our tools

**[08:51]** Not every engineer was using our tools and if they were using tools, they're

**[08:53]** and if they were using tools, they're

**[08:53]** and if they were using tools, they're only using a few of them. So we have

**[08:56]** only using a few of them. So we have

**[08:56]** only using a few of them. So we have tool usage. We're happy about that. But

**[08:59]** tool usage. We're happy about that. But


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** tool usage. We're happy about that. But we were under the hypothesis that true

**[09:02]** we were under the hypothesis that true

**[09:02]** we were under the hypothesis that true value is going to come from tying these

**[09:04]** value is going to come from tying these

**[09:04]** value is going to come from tying these tools together.

**[09:06]** tools together.

**[09:06]** tools together. So what if we owned orchestration of

**[09:08]** So what if we owned orchestration of

**[09:08]** So what if we owned orchestration of these tools rather than saying here's a

**[09:11]** these tools rather than saying here's a

**[09:11]** these tools rather than saying here's a suite of tools you use them as you wish

**[09:13]** suite of tools you use them as you wish

**[09:13]** suite of tools you use them as you wish what if we combined them and created an

**[09:16]** what if we combined them and created an

**[09:16]** what if we combined them and created an agent to orchestrate this. So this we

**[09:19]** agent to orchestrate this. So this we

**[09:19]** agent to orchestrate this. So this we are calling scout agent. We take that

**[09:22]** are calling scout agent. We take that

**[09:22]** are calling scout agent. We take that diagnosis run that against a ticket uh

**[09:26]** diagnosis run that against a ticket uh

**[09:26]** diagnosis run that against a ticket uh use that information to actually spin up

**[09:28]** use that information to actually spin up

**[09:28]** use that information to actually spin up a codegen tool which will then produce a

**[09:31]** a codegen tool which will then produce a

**[09:31]** a codegen tool which will then produce a merge request using all the right

**[09:33]** merge request using all the right

**[09:33]** merge request using all the right context.

**[09:35]** context.

**[09:35]** context. So who would benefit the most from

**[09:37]** So who would benefit the most from

**[09:37]** So who would benefit the most from orchestration? There are several

**[09:39]** orchestration? There are several

**[09:39]** orchestration? There are several integration teams at Zapier who are

**[09:42]** integration teams at Zapier who are

**[09:42]** integration teams at Zapier who are solving for these app fixes of various

**[09:44]** solving for these app fixes of various

**[09:44]** solving for these app fixes of various levels of complexity and there's the

**[09:46]** levels of complexity and there's the

**[09:46]** levels of complexity and there's the support team. So when we're saying who

**[09:49]** support team. So when we're saying who

**[09:49]** support team. So when we're saying who should be our first customer scout

**[09:50]** should be our first customer scout

**[09:50]** should be our first customer scout agent, we were thinking it should

**[09:52]** agent, we were thinking it should

**[09:52]** agent, we were thinking it should probably be the the team fielding small

**[09:55]** probably be the the team fielding small

**[09:55]** probably be the the team fielding small bugs that are emergent and coming hot

**[09:57]** bugs that are emergent and coming hot

**[09:57]** bugs that are emergent and coming hot off the queue which is the support team.


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** off the queue which is the support team.

**[10:00]** off the queue which is the support team. And now our two experiments merge

**[10:04]** And now our two experiments merge

**[10:04]** And now our two experiments merge and we have scout agent. We are building

**[10:06]** and we have scout agent. We are building

**[10:06]** and we have scout agent. We are building for the support team.

**[10:09]** for the support team.

**[10:09]** for the support team. And this is the flow of how it works.

**[10:11]** And this is the flow of how it works.

**[10:12]** And this is the flow of how it works. Support is submitting an issue to scout

**[10:14]** Support is submitting an issue to scout

**[10:14]** Support is submitting an issue to scout agent. We first categorize the issue. We

**[10:18]** agent. We first categorize the issue. We

**[10:18]** agent. We first categorize the issue. We next assess its fixability.

**[10:21]** next assess its fixability.

**[10:21]** next assess its fixability. Not every issue that comes from support

**[10:24]** Not every issue that comes from support

**[10:24]** Not every issue that comes from support can be fixed. If we thinks it's fixable,

**[10:27]** can be fixed. If we thinks it's fixable,

**[10:27]** can be fixed. If we thinks it's fixable, we'll move on to generating a merge

**[10:29]** we'll move on to generating a merge

**[10:29]** we'll move on to generating a merge request. At that point, the support

**[10:32]** request. At that point, the support

**[10:32]** request. At that point, the support team, this is the first time they're

**[10:34]** team, this is the first time they're

**[10:34]** team, this is the first time they're picking up the ticket. It already has a

**[10:35]** picking up the ticket. It already has a

**[10:35]** picking up the ticket. It already has a merge request attached to it. They'll

**[10:38]** merge request attached to it. They'll

**[10:38]** merge request attached to it. They'll review and test. If it's not satisfying

**[10:42]** review and test. If it's not satisfying

**[10:42]** review and test. If it's not satisfying what they believe is the actual solution

**[10:45]** what they believe is the actual solution

**[10:45]** what they believe is the actual solution or the the what what the solution should

**[10:48]** or the the what what the solution should

**[10:48]** or the the what what the solution should be to best address the customer's need,

**[10:51]** be to best address the customer's need,

**[10:51]** be to best address the customer's need, they will make a request for an

**[10:53]** they will make a request for an

**[10:53]** they will make a request for an adjustment that can happen right in

**[10:54]** adjustment that can happen right in

**[10:54]** adjustment that can happen right in GitLab, which is where we do our work

**[10:56]** GitLab, which is where we do our work

**[10:56]** GitLab, which is where we do our work and Scout will do another pass and

**[10:58]** and Scout will do another pass and

**[10:58]** and Scout will do another pass and hopefully at that point we've gotten it


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** hopefully at that point we've gotten it

**[11:00]** hopefully at that point we've gotten it right and support can submit that MR for

**[11:02]** right and support can submit that MR for

**[11:02]** right and support can submit that MR for review from engineering.

**[11:05]** review from engineering.

**[11:05]** review from engineering. How we are running Scout, it's all

**[11:07]** How we are running Scout, it's all

**[11:07]** How we are running Scout, it's all kicked off by a zap. This is a picture

**[11:09]** kicked off by a zap. This is a picture

**[11:09]** kicked off by a zap. This is a picture of one of our zaps. There are many zaps

**[11:11]** of one of our zaps. There are many zaps

**[11:11]** of one of our zaps. There are many zaps that's run this whole process and it

**[11:13]** that's run this whole process and it

**[11:17]** zaps. We do a ton of dog fooding at

**[11:18]** zaps. We do a ton of dog fooding at Zapier.

**[11:19]** Zapier.

**[11:19]** Zapier. We first run diagnosis and post that

**[11:21]** We first run diagnosis and post that

**[11:22]** We first run diagnosis and post that result to the Jira ticket saying what

**[11:26]** the categorization is if we believe it's

**[11:26]** the categorization is if we believe it's fixable. And then if we do believe it's

**[11:28]** fixable. And then if we do believe it's

**[11:28]** fixable. And then if we do believe it's fixable, we then are kicking off a

**[11:31]** fixable, we then are kicking off a

**[11:31]** fixable, we then are kicking off a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

**[11:34]** GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

**[11:34]** GitLab CI/CD pipeline. And we run three phases in that

**[11:35]** And we run three phases in that

**[11:36]** And we run three phases in that pipeline. plan, execute and validate to

**[11:39]** pipeline. plan, execute and validate to

**[11:39]** pipeline. plan, execute and validate to generate this merge request. The tools

**[11:41]** generate this merge request. The tools

**[11:41]** generate this merge request. The tools used in this pipeline is Scout MCP. So

**[11:44]** used in this pipeline is Scout MCP. So

**[11:44]** used in this pipeline is Scout MCP. So all those APIs we invested in a year ago

**[11:48]** all those APIs we invested in a year ago

**[11:48]** all those APIs we invested in a year ago now are really coming together and we're

**[11:50]** now are really coming together and we're

**[11:50]** now are really coming together and we're orchestrating it uh within the GitLab

**[11:53]** orchestrating it uh within the GitLab

**[11:53]** orchestrating it uh within the GitLab pipeline and we're also leveraging

**[11:55]** pipeline and we're also leveraging

**[11:55]** pipeline and we're also leveraging cursor SDK.

**[11:58]** cursor SDK.

**[11:58]** cursor SDK. Once the M merge request has been

**[11:59]** Once the M merge request has been

**[11:59]** Once the M merge request has been completed, we attach it to Jira and


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:02]** completed, we attach it to Jira and

**[12:02]** completed, we attach it to Jira and support picks it up.

**[12:04]** support picks it up.

**[12:04]** support picks it up. The latest addition to this is doing a

**[12:07]** The latest addition to this is doing a

**[12:07]** The latest addition to this is doing a rapid iteration once a um uh once a

**[12:13]** rapid iteration once a um uh once a

**[12:15]** ticket has been posted with the merge

**[12:15]** ticket has been posted with the merge request and support team is looking at

**[12:16]** request and support team is looking at

**[12:16]** request and support team is looking at it and they say, you know, it needs some

**[12:18]** it and they say, you know, it needs some

**[12:18]** it and they say, you know, it needs some tweaks to save them more time so they

**[12:21]** tweaks to save them more time so they

**[12:21]** tweaks to save them more time so they don't have to go pull that down to their

**[12:22]** don't have to go pull that down to their

**[12:22]** don't have to go pull that down to their ID, do the fixes, and push it back up.

**[12:24]** ID, do the fixes, and push it back up.

**[12:24]** ID, do the fixes, and push it back up. they can simply chat with the uh scout

**[12:27]** they can simply chat with the uh scout

**[12:28]** they can simply chat with the uh scout agent in gitlab that'll kick off another

**[12:30]** agent in gitlab that'll kick off another

**[12:30]** agent in gitlab that'll kick off another uh pipeline which does that phase with

**[12:33]** uh pipeline which does that phase with

**[12:33]** uh pipeline which does that phase with that new feedback and posts the new

**[12:36]** that new feedback and posts the new

**[12:36]** that new feedback and posts the new merge request

**[12:39]** merge request

**[12:39]** merge request on our side we want to make sure scout

**[12:41]** on our side we want to make sure scout

**[12:41]** on our side we want to make sure scout agent is working so we ask three

**[12:43]** agent is working so we ask three

**[12:43]** agent is working so we ask three questions categorization right is was it

**[12:46]** questions categorization right is was it

**[12:46]** questions categorization right is was it actually fixable uh and was the code fix

**[12:49]** actually fixable uh and was the code fix

**[12:49]** actually fixable uh and was the code fix accurate so far we have two eval

**[12:53]** accurate so far we have two eval

**[12:54]** accurate so far we have two eval to 75% accuracy for categorization and

**[12:56]** to 75% accuracy for categorization and

**[12:56]** to 75% accuracy for categorization and fixibility. As we get more feedback and

**[12:59]** fixibility. As we get more feedback and

**[12:59]** fixibility. As we get more feedback and process more tickets, those become our


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:01]** process more tickets, those become our

**[13:01]** process more tickets, those become our test cases and we can move forward

**[13:03]** test cases and we can move forward

**[13:03]** test cases and we can move forward improving scout agent over time. So what

**[13:07]** improving scout agent over time. So what

**[13:07]** improving scout agent over time. So what has been scout agents impact on app

**[13:09]** has been scout agents impact on app

**[13:09]** has been scout agents impact on app erosion

**[13:11]** erosion

**[13:11]** erosion 40% of supports support teams app fixes

**[13:15]** 40% of supports support teams app fixes

**[13:15]** 40% of supports support teams app fixes are being generated by scout. So we're

**[13:18]** are being generated by scout. So we're

**[13:18]** are being generated by scout. So we're doing more of the work on behalf of the

**[13:21]** doing more of the work on behalf of the

**[13:21]** doing more of the work on behalf of the support team.

**[13:23]** support team.

**[13:23]** support team. This is resulting and for some of our

**[13:25]** This is resulting and for some of our

**[13:25]** This is resulting and for some of our support team it's doubling their

**[13:27]** support team it's doubling their

**[13:27]** support team it's doubling their velocity from one to two tickets per

**[13:29]** velocity from one to two tickets per

**[13:29]** velocity from one to two tickets per week which already is amazing. That's

**[13:31]** week which already is amazing. That's

**[13:32]** week which already is amazing. That's going from a support team that wasn't

**[13:34]** going from a support team that wasn't

**[13:34]** going from a support team that wasn't shipping any fixes, well unofficially

**[13:36]** shipping any fixes, well unofficially

**[13:36]** shipping any fixes, well unofficially they were sometimes to now shipping one

**[13:38]** they were sometimes to now shipping one

**[13:38]** they were sometimes to now shipping one to two per week per person to now

**[13:40]** to two per week per person to now

**[13:40]** to two per week per person to now shipping three to four with the help of

**[13:42]** shipping three to four with the help of

**[13:42]** shipping three to four with the help of Scout.

**[13:43]** Scout.

**[13:44]** Scout. Another uh process improvement, Scout

**[13:47]** Another uh process improvement, Scout

**[13:47]** Another uh process improvement, Scout puts potentially fixable tickets right

**[13:49]** puts potentially fixable tickets right

**[13:49]** puts potentially fixable tickets right there in the triage flow. takes away a

**[13:53]** there in the triage flow. takes away a

**[13:53]** there in the triage flow. takes away a lot of the friction of looking for

**[13:54]** lot of the friction of looking for

**[13:54]** lot of the friction of looking for something to grab from the backlog.

**[13:57]** something to grab from the backlog.

**[13:59]** It's not just the support who's

**[13:59]** It's not just the support who's benefiting, it's also engineering.


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** benefiting, it's also engineering.

**[14:01]** benefiting, it's also engineering. Engineering manager said, uh, it's a

**[14:03]** Engineering manager said, uh, it's a

**[14:04]** Engineering manager said, uh, it's a great example of when it works. This

**[14:05]** great example of when it works. This

**[14:06]** great example of when it works. This tool allows us to stay focused on the

**[14:08]** tool allows us to stay focused on the

**[14:08]** tool allows us to stay focused on the more complex stuff.

**[14:10]** more complex stuff.

**[14:10]** more complex stuff. And if you take away anything from this

**[14:12]** And if you take away anything from this

**[14:12]** And if you take away anything from this talk, I hope it is that there is a

**[14:14]** talk, I hope it is that there is a
