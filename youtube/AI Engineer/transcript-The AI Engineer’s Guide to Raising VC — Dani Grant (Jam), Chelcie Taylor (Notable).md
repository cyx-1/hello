### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** the earliest stages, what investors are

**[02:00]** the earliest stages, what investors are banking on is you as a founder, the team

**[02:02]** banking on is you as a founder, the team

**[02:02]** banking on is you as a founder, the team that you can bring around you, the team

**[02:04]** that you can bring around you, the team

**[02:04]** that you can bring around you, the team that you can ultimately recruit, but

**[02:06]** that you can ultimately recruit, but

**[02:06]** that you can ultimately recruit, but importantly, the vision that you have

**[02:08]** importantly, the vision that you have

**[02:08]** importantly, the vision that you have for what this company can be. when

**[02:10]** for what this company can be. when

**[02:10]** for what this company can be. when you're investing at preeding and even

**[02:11]** you're investing at preeding and even

**[02:11]** you're investing at preeding and even seed, a good investor knows that the

**[02:14]** seed, a good investor knows that the

**[02:14]** seed, a good investor knows that the outcome in say seven 10 years that

**[02:16]** outcome in say seven 10 years that

**[02:16]** outcome in say seven 10 years that product's going to look dramatically

**[02:17]** product's going to look dramatically

**[02:17]** product's going to look dramatically different than what you came in and

**[02:19]** different than what you came in and

**[02:19]** different than what you came in and pitched them um at the moment. So I'd

**[02:21]** pitched them um at the moment. So I'd

**[02:21]** pitched them um at the moment. So I'd say what I would over emphasize on

**[02:23]** say what I would over emphasize on

**[02:23]** say what I would over emphasize on rather than do I have the perfect

**[02:25]** rather than do I have the perfect

**[02:25]** rather than do I have the perfect product because again the likelihood

**[02:26]** product because again the likelihood

**[02:26]** product because again the likelihood that that product works and is going to

**[02:28]** that that product works and is going to

**[02:28]** that that product works and is going to be sustainable across multiple cycles is

**[02:31]** be sustainable across multiple cycles is

**[02:31]** be sustainable across multiple cycles is unlikely. I'd really focus on like what

**[02:33]** unlikely. I'd really focus on like what

**[02:33]** unlikely. I'd really focus on like what is it about me, my team, and my core

**[02:36]** is it about me, my team, and my core

**[02:36]** is it about me, my team, and my core abilities to kind of see a unique

**[02:37]** abilities to kind of see a unique

**[02:37]** abilities to kind of see a unique insight in the market versus need being

**[02:40]** insight in the market versus need being

**[02:40]** insight in the market versus need being hyper obsessed with like having this

**[02:41]** hyper obsessed with like having this

**[02:42]** hyper obsessed with like having this perfect beautiful product on day one.

**[02:44]** perfect beautiful product on day one.

**[02:44]** perfect beautiful product on day one. What about this? Do you need to leave

**[02:46]** What about this? Do you need to leave

**[02:46]** What about this? Do you need to leave your full-time job to raise your first

**[02:48]** your full-time job to raise your first

**[02:48]** your full-time job to raise your first round of VC? Who thinks yes?

**[02:54]** It's such a show of the state of the

**[02:54]** It's such a show of the state of the market that only a couple people

**[02:56]** market that only a couple people

**[02:56]** market that only a couple people hesitantly were like, "Yes, you do need

**[02:57]** hesitantly were like, "Yes, you do need

**[02:57]** hesitantly were like, "Yes, you do need to be full-time to raise millions of

**[02:59]** to be full-time to raise millions of

**[02:59]** to be full-time to raise millions of dollars." Who thinks no?


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:02]** dollars." Who thinks no?

**[03:02]** dollars." Who thinks no? And I actually think that's a little bit

**[03:04]** And I actually think that's a little bit

**[03:04]** And I actually think that's a little bit more mixed. I think it's going to be

**[03:06]** more mixed. I think it's going to be

**[03:06]** more mixed. I think it's going to be firm dependent for sure. Um I think

**[03:08]** firm dependent for sure. Um I think

**[03:08]** firm dependent for sure. Um I think there's a lot of firms that are

**[03:10]** there's a lot of firms that are

**[03:10]** there's a lot of firms that are comfortable with folks who are like,

**[03:12]** comfortable with folks who are like,

**[03:12]** comfortable with folks who are like, look, I have a I'm out of a reputable

**[03:14]** look, I have a I'm out of a reputable

**[03:14]** look, I have a I'm out of a reputable tech company. I'm not ready to make the

**[03:16]** tech company. I'm not ready to make the

**[03:16]** tech company. I'm not ready to make the jump, but I've been working on this as a

**[03:17]** jump, but I've been working on this as a

**[03:17]** jump, but I've been working on this as a side project. Here's what I've done, and

**[03:19]** side project. Here's what I've done, and

**[03:19]** side project. Here's what I've done, and this is why I want this funding to kind

**[03:21]** this is why I want this funding to kind

**[03:21]** this is why I want this funding to kind of take that leap. I would say, however,

**[03:23]** of take that leap. I would say, however,

**[03:23]** of take that leap. I would say, however, if you know everything about venture

**[03:25]** if you know everything about venture

**[03:25]** if you know everything about venture capital is, and again, you should not be

**[03:27]** capital is, and again, you should not be

**[03:27]** capital is, and again, you should not be only building a company for VCs. I

**[03:29]** only building a company for VCs. I

**[03:29]** only building a company for VCs. I should say that first. But if you are

**[03:31]** should say that first. But if you are

**[03:31]** should say that first. But if you are raising from VCs, it's helpful to

**[03:33]** raising from VCs, it's helpful to

**[03:33]** raising from VCs, it's helpful to understand their psychology. What we're

**[03:35]** understand their psychology. What we're

**[03:35]** understand their psychology. What we're doing is we're trying to back obviously

**[03:37]** doing is we're trying to back obviously

**[03:37]** doing is we're trying to back obviously companies that can return funds. And as

**[03:39]** companies that can return funds. And as

**[03:39]** companies that can return funds. And as a result, we want people who have tons

**[03:40]** a result, we want people who have tons

**[03:40]** a result, we want people who have tons of conviction about what they're doing.

**[03:42]** of conviction about what they're doing.

**[03:42]** of conviction about what they're doing. And so one way to have a signal of

**[03:44]** And so one way to have a signal of

**[03:44]** And so one way to have a signal of conviction is you left your full-time

**[03:46]** conviction is you left your full-time

**[03:46]** conviction is you left your full-time job. Um so again, everything is going to

**[03:48]** job. Um so again, everything is going to

**[03:48]** job. Um so again, everything is going to be partner and company specific. But I

**[03:51]** be partner and company specific. But I

**[03:51]** be partner and company specific. But I would definitely say um it's never a bad

**[03:54]** would definitely say um it's never a bad

**[03:54]** would definitely say um it's never a bad thing if you've decided to leave your

**[03:55]** thing if you've decided to leave your

**[03:55]** thing if you've decided to leave your company and go fully in on building the

**[03:57]** company and go fully in on building the

**[03:57]** company and go fully in on building the business. I'm going to say something a

**[03:59]** business. I'm going to say something a

**[03:59]** business. I'm going to say something a little spicy which is um when we raised


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:02]** little spicy which is um when we raised

**[04:02]** little spicy which is um when we raised we were uh pre-product my co-founder had

**[04:04]** we were uh pre-product my co-founder had

**[04:04]** we were uh pre-product my co-founder had not yet left his job and so everything

**[04:06]** not yet left his job and so everything

**[04:06]** not yet left his job and so everything was potential when we did our first

**[04:09]** was potential when we did our first

**[04:09]** was potential when we did our first conversations with VCs it was all we're

**[04:12]** conversations with VCs it was all we're

**[04:12]** conversations with VCs it was all we're about to do blank we're going to show

**[04:13]** about to do blank we're going to show

**[04:13]** about to do blank we're going to show you a prototype but it was very early

**[04:15]** you a prototype but it was very early

**[04:15]** you a prototype but it was very early and I think it was a lot easier for us

**[04:17]** and I think it was a lot easier for us

**[04:17]** and I think it was a lot easier for us to raise our round when everything is

**[04:19]** to raise our round when everything is

**[04:19]** to raise our round when everything is potential versus like it actually took

**[04:21]** potential versus like it actually took

**[04:21]** potential versus like it actually took us a really long time to build a product

**[04:23]** us a really long time to build a product

**[04:23]** us a really long time to build a product that's so wow that a VC would have

**[04:25]** that's so wow that a VC would have

**[04:25]** that's so wow that a VC would have joined the call been like that is wow

**[04:30]** let's go And so like the earlier you can go the better. Um

**[04:32]** the earlier you can go the better. Um

**[04:32]** the earlier you can go the better. Um and one one way you can do that is raise

**[04:35]** and one one way you can do that is raise

### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:02]** cold email. So the best of course is not

**[06:02]** cold email. So the best of course is not a cold email, right? It's a warm intro.

**[06:04]** a cold email, right? It's a warm intro.

**[06:04]** a cold email, right? It's a warm intro. But most engineers don't know VCs. And

**[06:07]** But most engineers don't know VCs. And

**[06:07]** But most engineers don't know VCs. And so what do you do if you don't have a

**[06:09]** so what do you do if you don't have a

**[06:09]** so what do you do if you don't have a network? So how many people here think

**[06:11]** network? So how many people here think

**[06:11]** network? So how many people here think that VCs

**[06:13]** that VCs

**[06:13]** that VCs read cold emails sent to them?

**[06:17]** read cold emails sent to them?

**[06:18]** read cold emails sent to them? Do you read cold emails sent to you?

**[06:19]** Do you read cold emails sent to you?

**[06:19]** Do you read cold emails sent to you? I do. Um so this is Again, I think the

**[06:23]** I do. Um so this is Again, I think the

**[06:23]** I do. Um so this is Again, I think the intuition is correct here. VCs like

**[06:26]** intuition is correct here. VCs like

**[06:26]** intuition is correct here. VCs like anyone anyone like who has capital to

**[06:29]** anyone anyone like who has capital to

**[06:29]** anyone anyone like who has capital to sell, I suppose, is getting a lot of

**[06:30]** sell, I suppose, is getting a lot of

**[06:30]** sell, I suppose, is getting a lot of emails and getting inundated. However,

**[06:32]** emails and getting inundated. However,

**[06:32]** emails and getting inundated. However, it is also my job to hunt for deals,

**[06:34]** it is also my job to hunt for deals,

**[06:34]** it is also my job to hunt for deals, right? So, like I am a salesperson just

**[06:36]** right? So, like I am a salesperson just

**[06:36]** right? So, like I am a salesperson just like any other goto market person, but

**[06:38]** like any other goto market person, but

**[06:38]** like any other goto market person, but I'm trying to I'm trying to sell money

**[06:42]** that I have to amazing entrepreneurs.

**[06:42]** that I have to amazing entrepreneurs. So, I definitely read cold emails and I

**[06:45]** So, I definitely read cold emails and I

**[06:45]** So, I definitely read cold emails and I would I'm sure we'll go into these

**[06:46]** would I'm sure we'll go into these

**[06:46]** would I'm sure we'll go into these examples. What I will say is the cold

**[06:48]** examples. What I will say is the cold

**[06:48]** examples. What I will say is the cold emails that actually get answered by

**[06:50]** emails that actually get answered by

**[06:50]** emails that actually get answered by myself and I actually surveyed my team

**[06:52]** myself and I actually surveyed my team

**[06:52]** myself and I actually surveyed my team um across other kind of investment

**[06:54]** um across other kind of investment

**[06:54]** um across other kind of investment categories. They're usually cold emails

**[06:56]** categories. They're usually cold emails

**[06:56]** categories. They're usually cold emails that are prompted by some kind of warm

**[06:58]** that are prompted by some kind of warm

**[06:58]** that are prompted by some kind of warm signal. So it's exactly the same

**[06:59]** signal. So it's exactly the same


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** signal. So it's exactly the same playbook you would see in any type of go

**[07:01]** playbook you would see in any type of go

### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:01]** would you want to hear to be excited

**[14:01]** would you want to hear to be excited about someone to give them some of your

**[14:03]** about someone to give them some of your

**[14:03]** about someone to give them some of your limited amount of investment capital?

**[14:07]** limited amount of investment capital?

**[14:07]** limited amount of investment capital? Why you? Why now? So, I was asking

**[14:09]** Why you? Why now? So, I was asking

**[14:09]** Why you? Why now? So, I was asking Chelsea before this talk, what are the

**[14:10]** Chelsea before this talk, what are the

**[14:10]** Chelsea before this talk, what are the biggest mistakes that AI engineers

**[14:12]** biggest mistakes that AI engineers

**[14:12]** biggest mistakes that AI engineers especially make in pitches? And the top

**[14:15]** especially make in pitches? And the top

**[14:15]** especially make in pitches? And the top thing she said was engineers are so good

**[14:18]** thing she said was engineers are so good

**[14:18]** thing she said was engineers are so good at technology so they overfocus on it.

**[14:21]** at technology so they overfocus on it.

**[14:21]** at technology so they overfocus on it. But as an investor, I want to hear why

**[14:23]** But as an investor, I want to hear why

**[14:23]** But as an investor, I want to hear why you, why now?

**[14:24]** you, why now?

**[14:24]** you, why now? A thousand%. That's the exact answer.

**[14:26]** A thousand%. That's the exact answer.

**[14:26]** A thousand%. That's the exact answer. Um, again, I don't want to negate the

**[14:29]** Um, again, I don't want to negate the

**[14:29]** Um, again, I don't want to negate the importance of technology, right? We're

**[14:30]** importance of technology, right? We're

**[14:30]** importance of technology, right? We're building software. You need to have

**[14:31]** building software. You need to have

**[14:31]** building software. You need to have strong technical abilities. You need to

**[14:33]** strong technical abilities. You need to

**[14:33]** strong technical abilities. You need to build a really strong product. But in

**[14:35]** build a really strong product. But in

**[14:35]** build a really strong product. But in the early days, what I'm betting on is

**[14:37]** the early days, what I'm betting on is

**[14:38]** the early days, what I'm betting on is vision. And I'm betting on you. And so I

**[14:40]** vision. And I'm betting on you. And so I

**[14:40]** vision. And I'm betting on you. And so I want to hear and typically what works

**[14:42]** want to hear and typically what works

**[14:42]** want to hear and typically what works very well is I want to hear why you have

**[14:44]** very well is I want to hear why you have

**[14:44]** very well is I want to hear why you have a unique insight about the market or you

**[14:46]** a unique insight about the market or you

**[14:46]** a unique insight about the market or you have a unique insight about go to market

**[14:48]** have a unique insight about go to market

**[14:48]** have a unique insight about go to market or you have a unique insight about

**[14:50]** or you have a unique insight about

**[14:50]** or you have a unique insight about product or you have a unique insight

**[14:51]** product or you have a unique insight

**[14:52]** product or you have a unique insight about a customer segment because again

**[14:54]** about a customer segment because again

**[14:54]** about a customer segment because again there can be tons of companies that are

**[14:56]** there can be tons of companies that are

**[14:56]** there can be tons of companies that are doing the same thing but there will

**[14:57]** doing the same thing but there will

**[14:57]** doing the same thing but there will always be one typically or multiple that


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** always be one typically or multiple that

**[15:00]** always be one typically or multiple that are going to win and they're going to

**[15:01]** are going to win and they're going to

**[15:01]** are going to win and they're going to win for very unique ways and so to get

**[15:03]** win for very unique ways and so to get

**[15:03]** win for very unique ways and so to get kind of that asymmetric outcome I have

**[15:05]** kind of that asymmetric outcome I have

**[15:05]** kind of that asymmetric outcome I have to really believe that you're thinking

**[15:07]** to really believe that you're thinking

**[15:07]** to really believe that you're thinking in untraditional ways and so that's what

**[15:09]** in untraditional ways and so that's what

**[15:09]** in untraditional ways and so that's what the pitch I'm looking for. I'm often

**[15:11]** the pitch I'm looking for. I'm often

**[15:11]** the pitch I'm looking for. I'm often asking questions and trying to poke to

**[15:13]** asking questions and trying to poke to

**[15:13]** asking questions and trying to poke to see like is this a founder who's

**[15:15]** see like is this a founder who's

**[15:15]** see like is this a founder who's thinking about things in a very unique

**[15:16]** thinking about things in a very unique

**[15:16]** thinking about things in a very unique way. Um, and it's telling me why their

**[15:18]** way. Um, and it's telling me why their

**[15:18]** way. Um, and it's telling me why their unique perspective is grounded by some

**[15:20]** unique perspective is grounded by some

**[15:20]** unique perspective is grounded by some expertise they have from their lived

**[15:22]** expertise they have from their lived

**[15:22]** expertise they have from their lived experiences or something they read or

**[15:23]** experiences or something they read or

**[15:23]** experiences or something they read or something they saw um, etc. So,

**[15:26]** something they saw um, etc. So,

**[15:26]** something they saw um, etc. So, what is a good answer look like? Like

**[15:28]** what is a good answer look like? Like

**[15:28]** what is a good answer look like? Like how does someone do that in a way where

**[15:29]** how does someone do that in a way where

**[15:29]** how does someone do that in a way where you're like, "Wow, got it. I get why

**[15:31]** you're like, "Wow, got it. I get why

**[15:31]** you're like, "Wow, got it. I get why them."

**[15:32]** them."

**[15:32]** them." Yeah, that's a great question. And so

**[15:33]** Yeah, that's a great question. And so

**[15:33]** Yeah, that's a great question. And so I'd say probably the best way to do this

**[15:37]** I'd say probably the best way to do this

**[15:37]** I'd say probably the best way to do this is to usually start the pitch grounding

**[15:39]** is to usually start the pitch grounding

**[15:39]** is to usually start the pitch grounding it in like what is the core problem that

**[15:42]** it in like what is the core problem that

**[15:42]** it in like what is the core problem that you've identified that exists in the

**[15:44]** you've identified that exists in the

**[15:44]** you've identified that exists in the world today that either people already

**[15:46]** world today that either people already

**[15:46]** world today that either people already know and if they already know it and you

**[15:48]** know and if they already know it and you

**[15:48]** know and if they already know it and you know that it's a well-known problem then

**[15:50]** know that it's a well-known problem then

**[15:50]** know that it's a well-known problem then beginning to explain to them what got

**[15:52]** beginning to explain to them what got

**[15:52]** beginning to explain to them what got you to the point of seeing why your

**[15:54]** you to the point of seeing why your

**[15:54]** you to the point of seeing why your unique approach could be different. Um

**[15:56]** unique approach could be different. Um

**[15:56]** unique approach could be different. Um so for example I'm trying to a good

**[15:59]** so for example I'm trying to a good

**[15:59]** so for example I'm trying to a good example for is right now um we've been


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:02]** example for is right now um we've been

**[16:02]** example for is right now um we've been spending some time for in kind of the

**[16:04]** spending some time for in kind of the

**[16:04]** spending some time for in kind of the vertical AI application space and in

**[16:06]** vertical AI application space and in

**[16:06]** vertical AI application space and in particular looking at voice AI agents.

**[16:08]** particular looking at voice AI agents.

**[16:08]** particular looking at voice AI agents. Everyone is very familiar with the idea

**[16:10]** Everyone is very familiar with the idea

**[16:10]** Everyone is very familiar with the idea that voice AI likely will drive

**[16:13]** that voice AI likely will drive

**[16:13]** that voice AI likely will drive automation efficiency for industries

**[16:15]** automation efficiency for industries

**[16:15]** automation efficiency for industries where they really rely on phone calls.

**[16:18]** where they really rely on phone calls.

**[16:18]** where they really rely on phone calls. um that's pretty known. But what I think

**[16:20]** um that's pretty known. But what I think

**[16:20]** um that's pretty known. But what I think is interesting when we meet founders who

**[16:22]** is interesting when we meet founders who

**[16:22]** is interesting when we meet founders who are trying to go after say a different

**[16:24]** are trying to go after say a different

**[16:24]** are trying to go after say a different industry, there's things like what is

**[16:26]** industry, there's things like what is

**[16:26]** industry, there's things like what is why is this vertical segment or industry

**[16:28]** why is this vertical segment or industry

**[16:28]** why is this vertical segment or industry more unique than another? Like why did

**[16:29]** more unique than another? Like why did

**[16:29]** more unique than another? Like why did you choose to go after logistics and

**[16:31]** you choose to go after logistics and

**[16:31]** you choose to go after logistics and transportation versus after restaurants?

**[16:33]** transportation versus after restaurants?

**[16:33]** transportation versus after restaurants? And if you chose one like why did you

**[16:35]** And if you chose one like why did you

**[16:35]** And if you chose one like why did you choose that? Why is that industry so

**[16:37]** choose that? Why is that industry so

**[16:37]** choose that? Why is that industry so interesting? Oh, there's really good

**[16:39]** interesting? Oh, there's really good

**[16:39]** interesting? Oh, there's really good kind of workflow. You can be embedded in

**[16:40]** kind of workflow. You can be embedded in

**[16:40]** kind of workflow. You can be embedded in the workflow here. Oh, there's great

**[16:42]** the workflow here. Oh, there's great

**[16:42]** the workflow here. Oh, there's great data modes. Oh, like you start like

**[16:43]** data modes. Oh, like you start like

**[16:44]** data modes. Oh, like you start like unpacking in all of these layers of why

**[16:46]** unpacking in all of these layers of why

**[16:46]** unpacking in all of these layers of why a person has chosen a particular path.

**[16:48]** a person has chosen a particular path.

**[16:48]** a person has chosen a particular path. Um, and so it's actually not I wouldn't

**[16:50]** Um, and so it's actually not I wouldn't

**[16:50]** Um, and so it's actually not I wouldn't say it's even that um bespoke

**[16:53]** say it's even that um bespoke

**[16:53]** say it's even that um bespoke necessarily. I think it's really about

**[16:55]** necessarily. I think it's really about

**[16:55]** necessarily. I think it's really about kind of telling and someone said this

**[16:56]** kind of telling and someone said this

**[16:56]** kind of telling and someone said this earlier. It's about telling that

**[16:57]** earlier. It's about telling that

**[16:57]** earlier. It's about telling that narrative particularly well such that

**[16:59]** narrative particularly well such that

**[16:59]** narrative particularly well such that when I end the meeting I feel like okay


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:01]** when I end the meeting I feel like okay

**[17:01]** when I end the meeting I feel like okay you have a very cohesive vision around

**[17:03]** you have a very cohesive vision around

**[17:03]** you have a very cohesive vision around how this works and like even if we again

**[17:06]** how this works and like even if we again

**[17:06]** how this works and like even if we again know the core problem is very well

**[17:07]** know the core problem is very well

**[17:07]** know the core problem is very well understood that's okay. What we care

**[17:10]** understood that's okay. What we care

**[17:10]** understood that's okay. What we care more about is that you have identified

**[17:12]** more about is that you have identified

**[17:12]** more about is that you have identified something in that well understood

**[17:13]** something in that well understood

**[17:14]** something in that well understood problem that you can tackle very well.

**[17:16]** problem that you can tackle very well.

**[17:16]** problem that you can tackle very well. Okay. So, you're meeting with founders,

**[17:18]** Okay. So, you're meeting with founders,

**[17:18]** Okay. So, you're meeting with founders, you're uh figuring out who you're going

**[17:19]** you're uh figuring out who you're going

**[17:19]** you're uh figuring out who you're going to invest in. What else do you want to

**[17:21]** to invest in. What else do you want to

**[17:22]** to invest in. What else do you want to hear in order to decide this is the

**[17:24]** hear in order to decide this is the

**[17:24]** hear in order to decide this is the person?

**[17:34]** you said return on investment. Okay.

**[17:34]** you said return on investment. Okay. Yeah.

**[17:35]** Yeah.

**[17:35]** Yeah. Yes. So that was actually so I asked

**[17:36]** Yes. So that was actually so I asked

**[17:36]** Yes. So that was actually so I asked Chelsea what are the biggest mistakes

**[17:38]** Chelsea what are the biggest mistakes

**[17:38]** Chelsea what are the biggest mistakes engineers make when they start companies

**[17:39]** engineers make when they start companies

**[17:40]** engineers make when they start companies and pitch VCs and so the first one was

**[17:42]** and pitch VCs and so the first one was

**[17:42]** and pitch VCs and so the first one was overfocusing on technology underfocusing

**[17:44]** overfocusing on technology underfocusing

**[17:44]** overfocusing on technology underfocusing on the the you and the now um and the

**[17:47]** on the the you and the now um and the

**[17:47]** on the the you and the now um and the second is um talking too much about

**[17:51]** second is um talking too much about

**[17:51]** second is um talking too much about what's happening right now but

**[17:53]** what's happening right now but

**[17:53]** what's happening right now but forgetting to pause and sort of share

**[17:56]** forgetting to pause and sort of share

**[17:56]** forgetting to pause and sort of share how this goes from what it is today to

**[17:58]** how this goes from what it is today to

**[17:58]** how this goes from what it is today to how this could be a billion dollar


### [18:00 - 19:00]

**[18:00]** how this could be a billion dollar

**[18:00]** how this could be a billion dollar company.

**[18:01]** company.

**[18:01]** company. Exactly. And again, because we started

**[18:03]** Exactly. And again, because we started

**[18:03]** Exactly. And again, because we started this conversation saying you don't need

**[18:05]** this conversation saying you don't need

**[18:05]** this conversation saying you don't need revenue to raise, you don't need a

**[18:07]** revenue to raise, you don't need a

**[18:07]** revenue to raise, you don't need a product to even raise. Um, there's no

**[18:09]** product to even raise. Um, there's no

**[18:09]** product to even raise. Um, there's no real reason to go so deep on either of

**[18:12]** real reason to go so deep on either of

**[18:12]** real reason to go so deep on either of those things in early pitches. What I

**[18:14]** those things in early pitches. What I

**[18:14]** those things in early pitches. What I would again focus on is why do you think

**[18:17]** would again focus on is why do you think

**[18:17]** would again focus on is why do you think that you can achieve kind of larger

**[18:19]** that you can achieve kind of larger

**[18:19]** that you can achieve kind of larger revenue milestones down the line? Some

**[18:21]** revenue milestones down the line? Some

**[18:21]** revenue milestones down the line? Some ways to signal that would be, hey, I've

**[18:23]** ways to signal that would be, hey, I've

**[18:23]** ways to signal that would be, hey, I've spoken to X number of potential buyers.

**[18:27]** spoken to X number of potential buyers.

**[18:27]** spoken to X number of potential buyers. I have four of them raising their hand

**[18:29]** I have four of them raising their hand

**[18:29]** I have four of them raising their hand to be design partners. We're in very

**[18:31]** to be design partners. We're in very

**[18:31]** to be design partners. We're in very early ideiation stages, but I'm, you

**[18:33]** early ideiation stages, but I'm, you

**[18:33]** early ideiation stages, but I'm, you know, I'm guessing that maybe ACVs could

**[18:35]** know, I'm guessing that maybe ACVs could

**[18:35]** know, I'm guessing that maybe ACVs could look in this range. So, with that as an

**[18:37]** look in this range. So, with that as an

**[18:37]** look in this range. So, with that as an understanding, you know, I'm thinking we

**[18:40]** understanding, you know, I'm thinking we

**[18:40]** understanding, you know, I'm thinking we could get this far. Like I think as

**[18:42]** could get this far. Like I think as

**[18:42]** could get this far. Like I think as Danny started with thinking a lot about

**[18:44]** Danny started with thinking a lot about

**[18:44]** Danny started with thinking a lot about like what's the potential, what does

**[18:46]** like what's the potential, what does

**[18:46]** like what's the potential, what does that next phase look like? Is that's

**[18:48]** that next phase look like? Is that's

**[18:48]** that next phase look like? Is that's exactly what folks are betting on. And I

**[18:50]** exactly what folks are betting on. And I

**[18:50]** exactly what folks are betting on. And I think design partners in particular are

**[18:52]** think design partners in particular are

**[18:52]** think design partners in particular are a really great kind of anchor. And

**[18:53]** a really great kind of anchor. And

**[18:53]** a really great kind of anchor. And again, you don't have to have a product.

**[18:55]** again, you don't have to have a product.

**[18:55]** again, you don't have to have a product. And so maybe you're thinking how how am

**[18:57]** And so maybe you're thinking how how am

**[18:57]** And so maybe you're thinking how how am I a design partner when I don't even

**[18:58]** I a design partner when I don't even

**[18:58]** I a design partner when I don't even have a company or a product yet. Um so


### [19:00 - 20:00]

**[19:01]** have a company or a product yet. Um so

**[19:01]** have a company or a product yet. Um so if you don't want to call them design

**[19:02]** if you don't want to call them design

**[19:02]** if you don't want to call them design partners, you can even say like I've

**[19:03]** partners, you can even say like I've

**[19:04]** partners, you can even say like I've done some customer interviews. I've done

**[19:05]** done some customer interviews. I've done

**[19:05]** done some customer interviews. I've done some research. Having some of that stuff

**[19:06]** some research. Having some of that stuff

**[19:06]** some research. Having some of that stuff in your back pocket to say like hey this

**[19:08]** in your back pocket to say like hey this

**[19:08]** in your back pocket to say like hey this is real evidence I've heard in market.

**[19:10]** is real evidence I've heard in market.

**[19:10]** is real evidence I've heard in market. This is not hypothetical. I'm making it

**[19:12]** This is not hypothetical. I'm making it

**[19:12]** This is not hypothetical. I'm making it up that people would spend this much. I

**[19:14]** up that people would spend this much. I

**[19:14]** up that people would spend this much. I think again gives you some opportunity

**[19:17]** think again gives you some opportunity

**[19:17]** think again gives you some opportunity to talk about potential. But then also

**[19:18]** to talk about potential. But then also

**[19:18]** to talk about potential. But then also like you said begin to help the VC craft

**[19:21]** like you said begin to help the VC craft

**[19:22]** like you said begin to help the VC craft a narrative of what return on investment

**[19:23]** a narrative of what return on investment

**[19:23]** a narrative of what return on investment could look like. like how can I see this

**[19:25]** could look like. like how can I see this

**[19:25]** could look like. like how can I see this person basically scale this company to a

**[19:28]** person basically scale this company to a

**[19:28]** person basically scale this company to a phase where it could again return a

**[19:30]** phase where it could again return a

**[19:30]** phase where it could again return a portion of my fund or become a billion

**[19:31]** portion of my fund or become a billion

**[19:32]** portion of my fund or become a billion dollar business.

**[19:33]** dollar business.

**[19:33]** dollar business. When we went out to raise for the first

**[19:34]** When we went out to raise for the first

**[19:34]** When we went out to raise for the first time, Jam was so small and so and

**[19:37]** time, Jam was so small and so and

**[19:37]** time, Jam was so small and so and because we tried to build like an MVP

**[19:39]** because we tried to build like an MVP

**[19:39]** because we tried to build like an MVP and so the question we always got from

**[19:40]** and so the question we always got from

**[19:40]** and so the question we always got from VCs is why is this a product and not a

**[19:44]** VCs is why is this a product and not a

**[19:44]** VCs is why is this a product and not a feature? Why is this a why is this

**[19:46]** feature? Why is this a why is this

**[19:46]** feature? Why is this a why is this company and not a feature? And so what

**[19:49]** company and not a feature? And so what

**[19:49]** company and not a feature? And so what they were really asking us was not that

**[19:51]** they were really asking us was not that

**[19:51]** they were really asking us was not that they were asking us what's the path from

**[19:53]** they were asking us what's the path from

**[19:53]** they were asking us what's the path from where you are now to a billion-dollar uh

**[19:56]** where you are now to a billion-dollar uh

**[19:56]** where you are now to a billion-dollar uh company. And so we always used to say uh

**[19:59]** company. And so we always used to say uh

**[19:59]** company. And so we always used to say uh this is the first future of our future


### [20:00 - 21:00]

**[20:01]** this is the first future of our future

**[20:01]** this is the first future of our future product and then we would explain what

**[20:02]** product and then we would explain what

**[20:02]** product and then we would explain what the future product could look like and

**[20:03]** the future product could look like and

**[20:04]** the future product could look like and and how it gets there. Um but so but I

**[20:07]** and how it gets there. Um but so but I

**[20:07]** and how it gets there. Um but so but I think that was helpful for being able to

**[23:00]** be my ideal partner because they're

**[23:00]** be my ideal partner because they're talking about my category. they like do

**[23:02]** talking about my category. they like do

**[23:02]** talking about my category. they like do preede, they love AI engineers, then

**[23:05]** preede, they love AI engineers, then

**[23:05]** preede, they love AI engineers, then you're totally ready and you know um

**[23:07]** you're totally ready and you know um

**[23:07]** you're totally ready and you know um exactly what they're going to ask. So

**[23:08]** exactly what they're going to ask. So

**[23:12]** that sense of confidence. So on that note, Chelsea,

**[23:15]** So on that note, Chelsea,

**[23:15]** So on that note, Chelsea, what can an AI engineer expect to be

**[23:18]** what can an AI engineer expect to be

**[23:18]** what can an AI engineer expect to be asked?

**[23:19]** asked?

**[23:20]** asked? Great question. Um so it's going to

**[23:22]** Great question. Um so it's going to

**[23:22]** Great question. Um so it's going to range obviously, but I think there's

**[23:24]** range obviously, but I think there's

**[23:24]** range obviously, but I think there's obvious there's going to be a few core

**[23:25]** obvious there's going to be a few core

**[23:25]** obvious there's going to be a few core areas where we're going to really focus

**[23:27]** areas where we're going to really focus

**[23:27]** areas where we're going to really focus on. So, one is like I mentioned already,

**[23:30]** on. So, one is like I mentioned already,

**[23:30]** on. So, one is like I mentioned already, what is the problem that you're trying

**[23:31]** what is the problem that you're trying

**[23:31]** what is the problem that you're trying to solve and why you and in particular

**[23:34]** to solve and why you and in particular

**[23:34]** to solve and why you and in particular someone already alluded, why now? Um,

**[23:37]** someone already alluded, why now? Um,

**[23:37]** someone already alluded, why now? Um, then we're going to want to dive into

**[23:38]** then we're going to want to dive into

**[23:38]** then we're going to want to dive into like what is that solution or at least

**[23:40]** like what is that solution or at least

**[23:40]** like what is that solution or at least broadly what do you think that solution

**[23:41]** broadly what do you think that solution

**[23:42]** broadly what do you think that solution could look like? Um, you don't need to

**[23:43]** could look like? Um, you don't need to

**[23:43]** could look like? Um, you don't need to have the product. You don't even

**[23:45]** have the product. You don't even

**[23:45]** have the product. You don't even necessarily need to have mockups, but we

**[23:47]** necessarily need to have mockups, but we

**[23:47]** necessarily need to have mockups, but we do want to hear from you of some

**[23:48]** do want to hear from you of some

**[23:48]** do want to hear from you of some cohesive narrative as to what I think

**[23:51]** cohesive narrative as to what I think

**[23:51]** cohesive narrative as to what I think this product could look like and then

**[23:53]** this product could look like and then

**[23:53]** this product could look like and then how do I intend on keeping product

**[23:55]** how do I intend on keeping product

**[23:55]** how do I intend on keeping product velocity and iterating on the product to

**[23:57]** velocity and iterating on the product to

**[23:57]** velocity and iterating on the product to get me to a point um where it is working


### [24:00 - 25:00]

**[24:00]** get me to a point um where it is working

**[24:00]** get me to a point um where it is working and I think we can go to market more

**[24:02]** and I think we can go to market more

**[24:02]** and I think we can go to market more broadly with it. We then want are going

**[24:04]** broadly with it. We then want are going

**[24:04]** broadly with it. We then want are going to ask you about like who's your

**[24:05]** to ask you about like who's your

**[24:06]** to ask you about like who's your customer? What's your ICP? I'm sure you

**[24:07]** customer? What's your ICP? I'm sure you

**[24:07]** customer? What's your ICP? I'm sure you guys have all maybe heard that. If you

**[24:09]** guys have all maybe heard that. If you

**[24:09]** guys have all maybe heard that. If you haven't, ICP is ideal customer profile.

**[24:12]** haven't, ICP is ideal customer profile.

**[24:12]** haven't, ICP is ideal customer profile. Every VC will ask you this and the idea

**[24:14]** Every VC will ask you this and the idea

**[24:14]** Every VC will ask you this and the idea is come in with a good sense. Even if

**[24:17]** is come in with a good sense. Even if

**[24:17]** is come in with a good sense. Even if you don't know if that's factually it,

**[24:18]** you don't know if that's factually it,

**[24:18]** you don't know if that's factually it, you can say, "We're thinking it's two

**[24:20]** you can say, "We're thinking it's two

**[24:20]** you can say, "We're thinking it's two ICPs. Are we thinking it's three? This

**[24:22]** ICPs. Are we thinking it's three? This

**[24:22]** ICPs. Are we thinking it's three? This is how I'm going to test and learn to be

**[24:24]** is how I'm going to test and learn to be

**[24:24]** is how I'm going to test and learn to be able to really hone in and focus." Then

**[24:26]** able to really hone in and focus." Then

**[24:26]** able to really hone in and focus." Then we're obviously going to ask you about

**[24:27]** we're obviously going to ask you about

**[24:28]** we're obviously going to ask you about where do you think revenue goes for

**[24:29]** where do you think revenue goes for

**[24:29]** where do you think revenue goes for this? And so again, another way to back

**[24:31]** this? And so again, another way to back

**[24:31]** this? And so again, another way to back into these things because most of your

**[24:33]** into these things because most of your

**[24:33]** into these things because most of your companies aren't going to have revenue

**[24:34]** companies aren't going to have revenue

**[24:34]** companies aren't going to have revenue is ask yourself and explain to the the

**[24:37]** is ask yourself and explain to the the

**[24:37]** is ask yourself and explain to the the VC. So, I don't know just yet what how

**[24:39]** VC. So, I don't know just yet what how

**[24:40]** VC. So, I don't know just yet what how we're going to monetize the product, but

**[24:41]** we're going to monetize the product, but

**[24:41]** we're going to monetize the product, but I have a hypothesis that based upon

**[24:43]** I have a hypothesis that based upon

**[24:43]** I have a hypothesis that based upon conversations with customers, design

**[24:45]** conversations with customers, design

**[24:45]** conversations with customers, design partners that they want to buy a product

**[24:48]** partners that they want to buy a product

**[24:48]** partners that they want to buy a product in this range, they're thinking that

**[24:50]** in this range, they're thinking that

**[24:50]** in this range, they're thinking that they want it to be seatbased. Oh,

**[24:52]** they want it to be seatbased. Oh,

**[24:52]** they want it to be seatbased. Oh, actually, they want it to be usage

**[24:53]** actually, they want it to be usage

**[24:53]** actually, they want it to be usage based. Start to use some of these words

**[24:56]** based. Start to use some of these words

**[24:56]** based. Start to use some of these words that also signal to the investor that

**[24:57]** that also signal to the investor that

**[24:58]** that also signal to the investor that you're thinking about different

**[24:59]** you're thinking about different

**[24:59]** you're thinking about different monetization models so that they can


### [25:00 - 26:00]

**[25:00]** monetization models so that they can

**[25:00]** monetization models so that they can also give you feedback. They can say,

**[25:02]** also give you feedback. They can say,

**[25:02]** also give you feedback. They can say, "Oh, you know what? I've seen companies

**[25:03]** "Oh, you know what? I've seen companies

**[25:03]** "Oh, you know what? I've seen companies like yours who have tried this approach.

**[25:05]** like yours who have tried this approach.

**[25:05]** like yours who have tried this approach. this is typically the size deals they

**[25:07]** this is typically the size deals they

**[25:07]** this is typically the size deals they get and then now you can start building

**[25:08]** get and then now you can start building

**[25:08]** get and then now you can start building momentum with them to say like okay this

**[25:11]** momentum with them to say like okay this

**[25:11]** momentum with them to say like okay this is where I think we can go from a

**[25:12]** is where I think we can go from a

**[25:12]** is where I think we can go from a revenue trajectory and then the there's

**[25:14]** revenue trajectory and then the there's

**[25:14]** revenue trajectory and then the there's a few there's obviously more but the

**[25:15]** a few there's obviously more but the

**[25:59]** don't join it's okay like talk about

**[25:59]** don't join it's okay like talk about what you could do and how you can build


### [26:00 - 27:00]

**[26:01]** what you could do and how you can build

**[26:01]** what you could do and how you can build that momentum of attracting the best

**[26:03]** that momentum of attracting the best

**[26:03]** that momentum of attracting the best people to your company. Um, so there's a

**[26:05]** people to your company. Um, so there's a

**[26:05]** people to your company. Um, so there's a longer list of things we asked, but I

**[26:06]** longer list of things we asked, but I

**[26:06]** longer list of things we asked, but I say those were like the four or five

**[26:08]** say those were like the four or five

**[26:08]** say those were like the four or five core things.

**[26:09]** core things.

**[26:09]** core things. We um wanted to focus on what does a

**[26:11]** We um wanted to focus on what does a

**[26:11]** We um wanted to focus on what does a good answer because VCs hear a hundred

**[26:14]** good answer because VCs hear a hundred

**[26:14]** good answer because VCs hear a hundred answers uh to every question. And so

**[26:16]** answers uh to every question. And so

**[26:16]** answers uh to every question. And so then you're kind of stackranked like was

**[26:17]** then you're kind of stackranked like was

**[26:17]** then you're kind of stackranked like was that a good answer or an okay answer.

**[26:19]** that a good answer or an okay answer.

**[26:19]** that a good answer or an okay answer. And so we want you to hear exactly what

**[26:21]** And so we want you to hear exactly what

**[26:21]** And so we want you to hear exactly what a good answer might sound like to a

**[26:22]** a good answer might sound like to a

**[26:22]** a good answer might sound like to a couple of questions that usually

**[26:23]** couple of questions that usually

**[26:23]** couple of questions that usually engineers don't get asked in their

**[26:25]** engineers don't get asked in their

**[26:25]** engineers don't get asked in their engineering roles. So um Chelsea, how

**[26:27]** engineering roles. So um Chelsea, how

**[26:27]** engineering roles. So um Chelsea, how what what does a good answer sound like

**[26:30]** what what does a good answer sound like

**[26:30]** what what does a good answer sound like when you're asked about competitors?

**[26:32]** when you're asked about competitors?

**[26:32]** when you're asked about competitors? Great um question. And yes, competitors,

**[26:35]** Great um question. And yes, competitors,

**[26:35]** Great um question. And yes, competitors, I didn't mention that, but obviously

**[26:36]** I didn't mention that, but obviously

**[26:36]** I didn't mention that, but obviously will be a very important question that

**[26:38]** will be a very important question that

**[26:38]** will be a very important question that we're going to ask you. So, typically

**[26:40]** we're going to ask you. So, typically

**[26:40]** we're going to ask you. So, typically the best answers for competitors is one

**[26:42]** the best answers for competitors is one

**[26:42]** the best answers for competitors is one to acknowledge that there are

**[26:44]** to acknowledge that there are

**[26:44]** to acknowledge that there are competitors. Like, let's start there.

**[26:46]** competitors. Like, let's start there.

**[26:46]** competitors. Like, let's start there. Whenever we go into a pitch and we ask

**[26:48]** Whenever we go into a pitch and we ask

**[26:48]** Whenever we go into a pitch and we ask competitors and the founder tries to

**[26:50]** competitors and the founder tries to

**[26:50]** competitors and the founder tries to convince me that there's no competitors,

**[26:53]** convince me that there's no competitors,

**[26:53]** convince me that there's no competitors, it doesn't usually end well. So, I would

**[26:55]** it doesn't usually end well. So, I would

**[26:55]** it doesn't usually end well. So, I would say acknowledge that there are likely

**[26:57]** say acknowledge that there are likely

**[26:57]** say acknowledge that there are likely competitors, even if you don't think

**[26:59]** competitors, even if you don't think

**[26:59]** competitors, even if you don't think they're exactly the same. Then I would


### [27:00 - 28:00]

**[27:01]** they're exactly the same. Then I would

**[27:01]** they're exactly the same. Then I would say begin to and it's often what folks

**[27:03]** say begin to and it's often what folks

**[27:03]** say begin to and it's often what folks will do is kind of um you know kind of

**[27:06]** will do is kind of um you know kind of

**[27:06]** will do is kind of um you know kind of uh I guess aggregate where competitors

**[27:09]** uh I guess aggregate where competitors

**[27:09]** uh I guess aggregate where competitors sit on a spectrum compared to

**[27:10]** sit on a spectrum compared to

**[27:10]** sit on a spectrum compared to themselves. You've all seen this. Um but

**[27:12]** themselves. You've all seen this. Um but

**[27:12]** themselves. You've all seen this. Um but I would say really focus on that so you

**[27:14]** I would say really focus on that so you

**[27:14]** I would say really focus on that so you can maybe think of different axes in

**[27:16]** can maybe think of different axes in

**[27:16]** can maybe think of different axes in which your competitors work upon and

**[27:18]** which your competitors work upon and

**[27:18]** which your competitors work upon and then help VCs understand like why you're

**[27:20]** then help VCs understand like why you're

**[27:20]** then help VCs understand like why you're filling that wide space that is

**[27:22]** filling that wide space that is

**[27:22]** filling that wide space that is different than those competitors. And

**[27:23]** different than those competitors. And

**[27:23]** different than those competitors. And then this all goes back to like we said

**[27:25]** then this all goes back to like we said

**[27:25]** then this all goes back to like we said at the very beginning why you why now?

**[27:28]** at the very beginning why you why now?

**[27:28]** at the very beginning why you why now? What's your unique insight? It's okay to

**[27:30]** What's your unique insight? It's okay to

**[27:30]** What's your unique insight? It's okay to acknowledge if you are building

**[27:31]** acknowledge if you are building

**[27:32]** acknowledge if you are building something in I don't know AI go to

**[27:34]** something in I don't know AI go to

**[27:34]** something in I don't know AI go to market saying like okay there's already

**[27:36]** market saying like okay there's already

**[27:36]** market saying like okay there's already tools like zoom info that exist for data

**[27:38]** tools like zoom info that exist for data

**[27:38]** tools like zoom info that exist for data enrichment but then clay comes along and

**[27:40]** enrichment but then clay comes along and

**[27:40]** enrichment but then clay comes along and says well we think it's going to be

**[27:42]** says well we think it's going to be

**[27:42]** says well we think it's going to be different because we're going to

**[27:43]** different because we're going to

**[27:43]** different because we're going to aggregate the most data sources and no

**[27:44]** aggregate the most data sources and no

**[27:44]** aggregate the most data sources and no one's been able to do that like that

**[27:47]** one's been able to do that like that

**[27:47]** one's been able to do that like that actually was pretty compelling they've

**[27:48]** actually was pretty compelling they've

**[27:48]** actually was pretty compelling they've raised a lot of money they have a lot of

**[27:50]** raised a lot of money they have a lot of

**[27:50]** raised a lot of money they have a lot of momentum so again I think acknowledging

**[27:52]** momentum so again I think acknowledging

**[27:52]** momentum so again I think acknowledging competitors level setting for people how

**[27:54]** competitors level setting for people how

**[27:54]** competitors level setting for people how you see those competitors sitting in the

**[27:56]** you see those competitors sitting in the

**[27:56]** you see those competitors sitting in the market and then how does your company in

**[27:58]** market and then how does your company in

**[27:58]** market and then how does your company in relation to That is typically the

**[27:59]** relation to That is typically the


### [28:00 - 29:00]

**[28:00]** relation to That is typically the strongest answer.

**[28:01]** strongest answer.

**[28:01]** strongest answer. One thing I've heard Chelsea say in the

**[28:02]** One thing I've heard Chelsea say in the

**[28:02]** One thing I've heard Chelsea say in the past is like as a VC your job is to not

**[28:05]** past is like as a VC your job is to not

**[28:05]** past is like as a VC your job is to not only know all the competitors but also

**[28:07]** only know all the competitors but also

**[28:07]** only know all the competitors but also to have talked to all of them. And so

**[28:09]** to have talked to all of them. And so

**[28:09]** to have talked to all of them. And so they they know who they've had

**[28:10]** they they know who they've had

**[28:10]** they they know who they've had conversations with them. And so if you

**[28:12]** conversations with them. And so if you

**[28:12]** conversations with them. And so if you try to hide it, suddenly you become a

**[28:13]** try to hide it, suddenly you become a

**[28:14]** try to hide it, suddenly you become a person that's untrustworthy to work with

**[28:15]** person that's untrustworthy to work with

**[28:15]** person that's untrustworthy to work with versus acknowledging and saying like

**[28:17]** versus acknowledging and saying like

**[28:18]** versus acknowledging and saying like like it's a really exciting space. A lot

**[28:19]** like it's a really exciting space. A lot

**[28:19]** like it's a really exciting space. A lot of people are chasing it. Here's how

**[28:21]** of people are chasing it. Here's how

**[28:21]** of people are chasing it. Here's how we're doing it differently. I'd also say

**[28:22]** we're doing it differently. I'd also say

**[28:22]** we're doing it differently. I'd also say use it if the VC's again read the room

**[28:25]** use it if the VC's again read the room

**[28:25]** use it if the VC's again read the room with the VC, but like like Danny said,

**[28:27]** with the VC, but like like Danny said,

**[28:27]** with the VC, but like like Danny said, I've likely met all the competitors when

**[28:29]** I've likely met all the competitors when

**[28:29]** I've likely met all the competitors when I'm meeting a company. So try to get

**[28:31]** I'm meeting a company. So try to get

**[28:31]** I'm meeting a company. So try to get information from me. The best founders

**[28:33]** information from me. The best founders

**[28:33]** information from me. The best founders ask what why did you like that company

**[28:35]** ask what why did you like that company

**[28:35]** ask what why did you like that company or why did you pass on that company if

**[28:37]** or why did you pass on that company if

**[28:37]** or why did you pass on that company if you'd met them already? Like help me

**[28:39]** you'd met them already? Like help me

**[28:39]** you'd met them already? Like help me understand. And I actually really like

**[28:40]** understand. And I actually really like

**[28:40]** understand. And I actually really like that question.

**[28:41]** that question.

**[28:41]** that question. That's cool. Um how should uh how should

**[28:44]** That's cool. Um how should uh how should

**[28:44]** That's cool. Um how should uh how should an AI founder answer a question about go

**[28:46]** an AI founder answer a question about go

**[28:46]** an AI founder answer a question about go to market when they're raising their

**[28:47]** to market when they're raising their

**[28:48]** to market when they're raising their first round?

**[28:49]** first round?

**[28:49]** first round? Yeah. So the best thing to do here is

**[28:52]** Yeah. So the best thing to do here is

**[28:52]** Yeah. So the best thing to do here is again because go to market is going to

**[28:53]** again because go to market is going to

**[28:53]** again because go to market is going to be very nent is to talk about your

**[28:56]** be very nent is to talk about your

**[28:56]** be very nent is to talk about your vision of what you think go to market

**[28:57]** vision of what you think go to market

**[28:57]** vision of what you think go to market could look like and also provide some I


### [29:00 - 30:00]

**[29:00]** could look like and also provide some I

**[29:00]** could look like and also provide some I would say some frameworks of how you're

**[29:01]** would say some frameworks of how you're

**[29:01]** would say some frameworks of how you're thinking about it based upon other

**[29:03]** thinking about it based upon other

**[29:03]** thinking about it based upon other companies that have similar models to

**[29:05]** companies that have similar models to

**[29:05]** companies that have similar models to you. So for example if you know that

**[29:07]** you. So for example if you know that

**[29:07]** you. So for example if you know that you're going to go after kind of a usage

**[29:09]** you're going to go after kind of a usage

**[29:09]** you're going to go after kind of a usage based model say you know I think our

**[29:11]** based model say you know I think our

**[29:11]** based model say you know I think our company is going to follow a go to

**[29:13]** company is going to follow a go to

**[29:13]** company is going to follow a go to market or I'm thinking more monetization

**[29:15]** market or I'm thinking more monetization

**[29:15]** market or I'm thinking more monetization but maybe we're going to follow a PLG

**[29:17]** but maybe we're going to follow a PLG

**[29:17]** but maybe we're going to follow a PLG approach. We want to follow other PLG

**[29:19]** approach. We want to follow other PLG

**[29:19]** approach. We want to follow other PLG companies like X. We think this is

**[29:21]** companies like X. We think this is

**[29:21]** companies like X. We think this is successful for Y and we want to pursue

**[29:23]** successful for Y and we want to pursue

**[29:23]** successful for Y and we want to pursue this with these kind of tiers

**[29:25]** this with these kind of tiers

**[29:25]** this with these kind of tiers understanding pricing is going to change

**[29:26]** understanding pricing is going to change

**[29:26]** understanding pricing is going to change a lot but this is what we're

**[29:27]** a lot but this is what we're

**[29:27]** a lot but this is what we're directionally thinking of how it will

**[29:28]** directionally thinking of how it will

**[29:28]** directionally thinking of how it will work and then ask for like how have you

**[29:31]** work and then ask for like how have you

**[29:31]** work and then ask for like how have you seen this work? Do you work with a lot

**[29:32]** seen this work? Do you work with a lot

**[29:32]** seen this work? Do you work with a lot of PLG companies and get feedback? So

**[29:34]** of PLG companies and get feedback? So

**[29:34]** of PLG companies and get feedback? So I'd say try to come in with some sense

**[29:36]** I'd say try to come in with some sense

**[29:36]** I'd say try to come in with some sense of like what the motion will look like.

**[29:39]** of like what the motion will look like.

**[29:39]** of like what the motion will look like. have some directional sense of what you

**[29:40]** have some directional sense of what you

**[29:40]** have some directional sense of what you think pricing could look like, but then

**[29:42]** think pricing could look like, but then

**[29:42]** think pricing could look like, but then obviously then anchor it on we need to

**[29:44]** obviously then anchor it on we need to

**[29:44]** obviously then anchor it on we need to experiment and test um versus saying

**[29:47]** experiment and test um versus saying

**[29:47]** experiment and test um versus saying that you're going to know exactly what

**[29:48]** that you're going to know exactly what

**[29:48]** that you're going to know exactly what it is.

**[29:49]** it is.

**[29:49]** it is. We've been hijacked. We're unhacked.

**[29:58]** Um last question for you on this. What

**[29:58]** Um last question for you on this. What do engineers specifically when they're


### [30:00 - 31:00]

**[30:00]** do engineers specifically when they're

**[30:00]** do engineers specifically when they're pitching AI startups tend to get wrong

**[30:02]** pitching AI startups tend to get wrong

**[30:02]** pitching AI startups tend to get wrong in the pitch meeting?

**[30:04]** in the pitch meeting?

**[30:04]** in the pitch meeting? I think we've addressed a few of these

**[30:06]** I think we've addressed a few of these

**[30:06]** I think we've addressed a few of these points already and so um I won't belabor

**[30:09]** points already and so um I won't belabor

**[30:09]** points already and so um I won't belabor it. I think the biggest thing that I

**[30:11]** it. I think the biggest thing that I

**[30:11]** it. I think the biggest thing that I would recommend you not do is get so in

**[30:15]** would recommend you not do is get so in

**[30:15]** would recommend you not do is get so in the weeds around your particular product

**[30:18]** the weeds around your particular product

**[30:18]** the weeds around your particular product or technology. I think it's super

**[30:20]** or technology. I think it's super

**[30:20]** or technology. I think it's super important. But typically what VCs will

**[30:22]** important. But typically what VCs will

**[30:22]** important. But typically what VCs will do is they're using the VC pitch meeting

**[30:24]** do is they're using the VC pitch meeting

**[30:24]** do is they're using the VC pitch meeting with the investor. Unless you're meeting

**[30:26]** with the investor. Unless you're meeting

**[30:26]** with the investor. Unless you're meeting an investor who's highly technical,

**[30:27]** an investor who's highly technical,

**[30:27]** an investor who's highly technical, which do your research beforehand, but

**[30:29]** which do your research beforehand, but

**[30:29]** which do your research beforehand, but if you're meeting the average VC who's

**[30:31]** if you're meeting the average VC who's

**[30:31]** if you're meeting the average VC who's probably not super technical, what

**[30:33]** probably not super technical, what

**[30:33]** probably not super technical, what they're again betting on is person,

**[30:35]** they're again betting on is person,

**[30:35]** they're again betting on is person, vision, product, vision, um, future

**[30:38]** vision, product, vision, um, future

**[30:38]** vision, product, vision, um, future state. And usually what we do at our

**[30:40]** state. And usually what we do at our

**[30:40]** state. And usually what we do at our firm is we set aside an entirely

**[30:41]** firm is we set aside an entirely

**[30:41]** firm is we set aside an entirely different hour session with our VP of

**[30:43]** different hour session with our VP of

**[30:43]** different hour session with our VP of technology to do a deep dive on the

**[30:45]** technology to do a deep dive on the

**[30:45]** technology to do a deep dive on the tech. So don't spend that first meeting

**[30:48]** tech. So don't spend that first meeting

**[30:48]** tech. So don't spend that first meeting where you're really trying to hook them

**[30:50]** where you're really trying to hook them

**[30:50]** where you're really trying to hook them and sell them on your vision, going so

**[30:52]** and sell them on your vision, going so

**[30:52]** and sell them on your vision, going so deep on the technology that you never

**[30:53]** deep on the technology that you never

**[30:53]** deep on the technology that you never even talk about the vision, the go to

**[30:54]** even talk about the vision, the go to

**[30:54]** even talk about the vision, the go to market, the future. So I'd say that's

**[30:56]** market, the future. So I'd say that's

**[30:56]** market, the future. So I'd say that's probably the biggest. Um, and then the

**[30:58]** probably the biggest. Um, and then the

**[30:58]** probably the biggest. Um, and then the last thing I will say is not using this


### [31:00 - 32:00]

**[31:01]** last thing I will say is not using this

**[31:01]** last thing I will say is not using this time to really test if you want to work

**[31:02]** time to really test if you want to work

**[31:02]** time to really test if you want to work with them. I know it does feel like

**[31:04]** with them. I know it does feel like

**[31:04]** with them. I know it does feel like early on that you want to make sure

**[31:06]** early on that you want to make sure

**[31:06]** early on that you want to make sure you're just getting as much

**[31:07]** you're just getting as much

**[31:07]** you're just getting as much opportunities as possible and you just

**[31:09]** opportunities as possible and you just

**[31:09]** opportunities as possible and you just want to speak to VCs potentially. Um,

**[31:11]** want to speak to VCs potentially. Um,

**[31:11]** want to speak to VCs potentially. Um, but I just as respect the founders who

**[31:13]** but I just as respect the founders who

**[31:13]** but I just as respect the founders who have a firm sense of like this is what

**[31:15]** have a firm sense of like this is what

**[31:15]** have a firm sense of like this is what I'm looking for. And when I ask them

**[31:17]** I'm looking for. And when I ask them

**[31:17]** I'm looking for. And when I ask them like hey tell me what you're looking for

**[31:18]** like hey tell me what you're looking for

**[31:18]** like hey tell me what you're looking for and who you want to work with, they're

**[31:20]** and who you want to work with, they're

**[31:20]** and who you want to work with, they're like these are the things I need to get

**[31:21]** like these are the things I need to get

**[31:21]** like these are the things I need to get to this next phase.

**[31:23]** to this next phase.

**[31:23]** to this next phase. So you've just done your first pitch

**[31:24]** So you've just done your first pitch

**[31:24]** So you've just done your first pitch meeting, you're raising your first

**[31:25]** meeting, you're raising your first

**[31:26]** meeting, you're raising your first round, you're doing you just you've been

**[31:27]** round, you're doing you just you've been

**[31:27]** round, you're doing you just you've been through the whole meeting and now the

**[31:29]** through the whole meeting and now the

**[31:29]** through the whole meeting and now the meeting is wrapping up. How do you end

**[31:31]** meeting is wrapping up. How do you end

**[31:33]** it? Do you ask about next step? What do

**[31:33]** it? Do you ask about next step? What do you say?

**[31:34]** you say?

**[31:34]** you say? Yes. If the VC is not um asking next
