## Executive Summary

Alvaro Morales, CEO of Orb, presents a comprehensive framework for AI pricing strategy at the AI Engineer conference. He argues that the industry should move beyond "pricing on vibes" and adopt data-driven approaches to monetization. The talk covers three key frameworks: (1) whether to monetize AI directly or indirectly, (2) selecting the right value metric (from token-based to outcome-based pricing), and (3) building a culture of continuous pricing experimentation. Alvaro demonstrates Orb Simulations, a tool that allows companies to back-test pricing strategies on real usage data before launching to customers. The presentation emphasizes that AI pricing is uniquely challenging due to rapid cost changes, high COGS pressure, and customer demands for clear ROI, requiring more frequent iteration than traditional SaaS pricing cycles.

## Key Topics & Timestamps

### [Introduction & Why AI Pricing is Uniquely Challenging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=0s)
- [00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=17s) - Alvaro introduces the topic of AI monetization strategies
- [00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=51s) - Background on Orb and partnerships with companies like Vercel, Replit, and Perplexity
- [01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=90s) - Three unique challenges of AI pricing:
  - Rapid changes in model costs and capabilities
  - High COGS and margin pressures
  - Customer demand for clear ROI

**Key Points:**
- Innovation ecosystem requires effective value capture
- ChatGPT Pro at $200 became a loss driver for OpenAI, highlighting pricing difficulties
- Traditional SaaS pricing approaches don't work for AI products

### [Framework #1: Should You Monetize AI?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=207s)
- [03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=209s) - Direct vs. indirect monetization framework (from Simon-Kucher)
- [04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=253s) - **GitHub Copilot example**: Separable add-on monetization
- [04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=282s) - **Notion AI example**: Started as add-on, evolved to bundled tier strategy
- [05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=314s) - **Expedia example**: Free AI feature (Instagram reels to bookable trips) to drive indirect revenue

**Key Points:**
- Direct monetization: Standalone products or add-ons
- Indirect monetization: Driving upsells or bundling for free to incentivize desired behaviors
- Decision depends on whether the feature adds value to everyone or just a niche audience

### [Framework #2: Selecting the Right Value Metric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=361s)
- [06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=367s) - Value metric spectrum for AI agents: from resource-based to outcome-based
- [07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=429s) - **Vercel V0 example**: Token-based pricing aligned with developer audience
- [07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=446s) - **Zapier example**: Task-based pricing (proxies of value)
- [07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=468s) - **Intercom Fin example**: True outcome-based pricing at $0.99 per successful customer support ticket resolution

**Key Points:**
- Spectrum ranges from: Tokens → Workflow steps → Entire workflows → Labor replacement → True outcomes
- Outcome-based pricing is "literally ROI, not a proxy"
- Challenge: Customer and vendor must align on outcome definition and measurement
- Most successful outcome-based examples are currently in customer support category

### [Framework #3: Continuous Pricing Experimentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=578s)
- [09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=578s) - Need for continual pricing evolution vs. old 1-3 year SaaS cycles
- [10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=614s) - Model drops can change costs by 10x overnight (e.g., Claude 4)
- [10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=642s) - Importance of holistic pricing experience: packaging, rate limits, volumes, communication

**Key Points:**
- Traditional "ship and wait" approach doesn't work with AI's rapid cost changes
- Pricing includes packaging, rate limits, custom terms, and customer communication
- Best teams drive continuous experimentation

### [Tool Demo: Orb Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=672s)
