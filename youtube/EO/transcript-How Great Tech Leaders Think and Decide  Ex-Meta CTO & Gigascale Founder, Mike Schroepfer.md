**[00:19]** browser helped ship 152030 back when

**[00:19]** browser helped ship 152030 back when version numbers were small. They weren't

**[00:20]** version numbers were small. They weren't

**[00:20]** version numbers were small. They weren't in the '7s. And then in 2008 I joined a

**[00:22]** in the '7s. And then in 2008 I joined a

**[00:22]** in the '7s. And then in 2008 I joined a little social network called Facebook

**[00:24]** little social network called Facebook

**[00:24]** little social network called Facebook which was you know smaller than MySpace

**[00:26]** which was you know smaller than MySpace

**[00:26]** which was you know smaller than MySpace at the time. And then over the next

**[00:28]** at the time. And then over the next

**[00:28]** at the time. And then over the next 14-15 years led engineering, built data

**[00:30]** 14-15 years led engineering, built data

**[00:30]** 14-15 years led engineering, built data centers, uh took us into the consumer

**[00:32]** centers, uh took us into the consumer

**[00:37]** billion-dollar acquisitions, built an AI research lab, sort of build hardware,

**[00:38]** research lab, sort of build hardware,

**[00:38]** research lab, sort of build hardware, software, enterprise, and consumer, and

**[00:40]** software, enterprise, and consumer, and

**[00:40]** software, enterprise, and consumer, and scaled the team from, you know, 100 to

**[00:42]** scaled the team from, you know, 100 to

**[00:42]** scaled the team from, you know, 100 to 35,000ish. I'm now helping great

**[00:45]** 35,000ish. I'm now helping great

**[00:45]** 35,000ish. I'm now helping great entrepreneurs through starting a venture

**[00:47]** entrepreneurs through starting a venture

**[00:47]** entrepreneurs through starting a venture capital firm called Gigascale Capital

**[00:49]** capital firm called Gigascale Capital

**[00:49]** capital firm called Gigascale Capital where we are hunting for founders with

**[00:51]** where we are hunting for founders with

**[00:51]** where we are hunting for founders with big ideas using technological advances

**[00:54]** big ideas using technological advances

**[00:54]** big ideas using technological advances to build products that makes people's

**[00:55]** to build products that makes people's

**[00:56]** to build products that makes people's lives better. and it solves a climate

**[00:57]** lives better. and it solves a climate

**[00:58]** lives better. and it solves a climate environmental problem and it turns out

**[00:59]** environmental problem and it turns out

**[00:59]** environmental problem and it turns out to actually be a great business along


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** to actually be a great business along

**[01:00]** to actually be a great business along the way. Easy example of this that is

**[01:02]** the way. Easy example of this that is

**[01:02]** the way. Easy example of this that is you know electric vehicles spew no

**[01:04]** you know electric vehicles spew no

**[01:04]** you know electric vehicles spew no pollution. They're cheaper to operate.

**[01:05]** pollution. They're cheaper to operate.

**[01:06]** pollution. They're cheaper to operate. They're cheaper to maintain. They're

**[01:07]** They're cheaper to maintain. They're

**[01:07]** They're cheaper to maintain. They're faster. They're quieter. They have been

**[01:09]** faster. They're quieter. They have been

**[01:09]** faster. They're quieter. They have been traditionally more expensive. But as

**[01:11]** traditionally more expensive. But as

**[01:11]** traditionally more expensive. But as batteries get cheaper and cheaper,

**[01:12]** batteries get cheaper and cheaper,

**[01:12]** batteries get cheaper and cheaper, they're getting more and more cost

**[01:14]** they're getting more and more cost

**[01:14]** they're getting more and more cost competitive. And so we're looking for

**[01:15]** competitive. And so we're looking for

**[01:16]** competitive. And so we're looking for products that are cost competitive and

**[01:18]** products that are cost competitive and

**[01:18]** products that are cost competitive and people love and then also are better for

**[01:20]** people love and then also are better for

**[01:20]** people love and then also are better for human health and for the planet. That's

**[01:22]** human health and for the planet. That's

**[01:22]** human health and for the planet. That's a version of what we do.

**[01:38]** It was August or September of 2008. We

**[01:38]** It was August or September of 2008. We had a product that people loved, the

**[01:40]** had a product that people loved, the

**[01:40]** had a product that people loved, the website facebook.com. More people were

**[01:42]** website facebook.com. More people were

**[01:42]** website facebook.com. More people were signing up every day. Those are new

**[01:43]** signing up every day. Those are new

**[01:43]** signing up every day. Those are new features being added to the site all the

**[01:45]** features being added to the site all the

**[01:45]** features being added to the site all the time. At the time, the most urgent

**[01:47]** time. At the time, the most urgent

**[01:47]** time. At the time, the most urgent problem was scale. Literally the problem

**[01:50]** problem was scale. Literally the problem

**[01:50]** problem was scale. Literally the problem was you know every week or every month

**[01:51]** was you know every week or every month

**[01:51]** was you know every week or every month on keeping the site running and the

**[01:54]** on keeping the site running and the

**[01:54]** on keeping the site running and the software backbone and hardware backbone

**[01:56]** software backbone and hardware backbone

**[01:56]** software backbone and hardware backbone for building this sort of product didn't

**[01:58]** for building this sort of product didn't

**[01:58]** for building this sort of product didn't really exist. So a lot of the first many


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** really exist. So a lot of the first many

**[02:00]** really exist. So a lot of the first many years I spent there was scaling and

**[02:03]** years I spent there was scaling and

**[02:03]** years I spent there was scaling and rebuilding the software architecture of

**[02:05]** rebuilding the software architecture of

**[02:05]** rebuilding the software architecture of the site and then building the hardware

**[02:07]** the site and then building the hardware

**[02:07]** the site and then building the hardware infrastructure to do this. You know when

**[02:08]** infrastructure to do this. You know when

**[02:08]** infrastructure to do this. You know when I first got there we were releasing

**[02:10]** I first got there we were releasing

**[02:10]** I first got there we were releasing space in those data centers and putting

**[02:11]** space in those data centers and putting

**[02:11]** space in those data centers and putting servers in them and and building it up.

**[02:13]** servers in them and and building it up.

**[02:13]** servers in them and and building it up. But because of the financial crisis of

**[02:15]** But because of the financial crisis of

**[02:15]** But because of the financial crisis of the real estate crisis in 2008, people

**[02:17]** the real estate crisis in 2008, people

**[02:17]** the real estate crisis in 2008, people had stopped building large data centers

**[02:19]** had stopped building large data centers

**[02:19]** had stopped building large data centers and so we couldn't get more space. So we

**[02:21]** and so we couldn't get more space. So we

**[02:21]** and so we couldn't get more space. So we had to build our own and there was a lot

**[02:23]** had to build our own and there was a lot

**[02:23]** had to build our own and there was a lot of challenges and you know we had to

**[02:24]** of challenges and you know we had to

**[02:24]** of challenges and you know we had to learn a lot. None of these things were

**[02:25]** learn a lot. None of these things were

**[02:25]** learn a lot. None of these things were perfect the first time. We made some

**[02:26]** perfect the first time. We made some

**[02:26]** perfect the first time. We made some mistakes and we had to fix them and we

**[02:28]** mistakes and we had to fix them and we

**[02:28]** mistakes and we had to fix them and we had enough humility to know that we had

**[02:31]** had enough humility to know that we had

**[02:31]** had enough humility to know that we had to learn a bunch of new things and so

**[02:33]** to learn a bunch of new things and so

**[02:33]** to learn a bunch of new things and so you know the first goal was hiring

**[02:34]** you know the first goal was hiring

**[02:34]** you know the first goal was hiring people who had done data center work who

**[02:36]** people who had done data center work who

**[02:36]** people who had done data center work who had done network design people with the

**[02:37]** had done network design people with the

**[02:37]** had done network design people with the actual background in this space. So the

**[02:39]** actual background in this space. So the

**[02:39]** actual background in this space. So the goal was go hire a team to understand

**[02:41]** goal was go hire a team to understand

**[02:41]** goal was go hire a team to understand this new area and then help us get good.

**[02:44]** this new area and then help us get good.

**[02:44]** this new area and then help us get good. Like many problems in a company, you

**[02:45]** Like many problems in a company, you

**[02:45]** Like many problems in a company, you know, if you're a founder or prospective

**[02:47]** know, if you're a founder or prospective

**[02:47]** know, if you're a founder or prospective founder watching this, most of the

**[02:49]** founder watching this, most of the

**[02:49]** founder watching this, most of the things a startup does, it does out of

**[02:51]** things a startup does, it does out of

**[02:51]** things a startup does, it does out of just complete necessity. It's like,

**[02:53]** just complete necessity. It's like,

**[02:53]** just complete necessity. It's like, well, we can't get space. We don't

**[02:54]** well, we can't get space. We don't

**[02:54]** well, we can't get space. We don't really have a choice here. We have to

**[02:56]** really have a choice here. We have to

**[02:56]** really have a choice here. We have to figure this out. One of the lessons that

**[02:58]** figure this out. One of the lessons that

**[02:58]** figure this out. One of the lessons that I took away was there's no getting away


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** I took away was there's no getting away

**[03:01]** I took away was there's no getting away from the hard problems. You just got to

**[03:03]** from the hard problems. You just got to

**[03:03]** from the hard problems. You just got to get to it. So it's like okay if we need

**[03:04]** get to it. So it's like okay if we need

**[03:04]** get to it. So it's like okay if we need to solve this problem let's like figure

**[03:06]** to solve this problem let's like figure

**[03:06]** to solve this problem let's like figure out what are the critical risks what are

**[03:07]** out what are the critical risks what are

**[03:07]** out what are the critical risks what are the things we understand the least or

**[03:09]** the things we understand the least or

**[03:09]** the things we understand the least or the highest technical risks and let's

**[03:10]** the highest technical risks and let's

**[03:10]** the highest technical risks and let's work on those first. I think there's

**[03:12]** work on those first. I think there's

**[03:12]** work on those first. I think there's this like human instinct to solve

**[03:14]** this like human instinct to solve

**[03:14]** this like human instinct to solve tractable problems. So it's kind of like

**[03:16]** tractable problems. So it's kind of like

**[03:16]** tractable problems. So it's kind of like I've got this task I want to do but my

**[03:18]** I've got this task I want to do but my

**[03:18]** I've got this task I want to do but my room's kind of messy. I'm going to go

**[03:19]** room's kind of messy. I'm going to go

**[03:19]** room's kind of messy. I'm going to go clean my whole office. I don't want to

**[03:20]** clean my whole office. I don't want to

**[03:20]** clean my whole office. I don't want to go work on the hard thing. And like

**[03:21]** go work on the hard thing. And like

**[03:21]** go work on the hard thing. And like that's a very human sort of trait. So

**[03:24]** that's a very human sort of trait. So

**[03:24]** that's a very human sort of trait. So it's like important to work against it.

**[03:25]** it's like important to work against it.

**[03:25]** it's like important to work against it. Say like actually no it doesn't matter.

**[03:27]** Say like actually no it doesn't matter.

**[03:27]** Say like actually no it doesn't matter. My office is messy. like if I don't get

**[03:29]** My office is messy. like if I don't get

**[03:29]** My office is messy. like if I don't get this pitch done right and get raise

**[03:30]** this pitch done right and get raise

**[03:30]** this pitch done right and get raise money for this company, then nothing

**[03:32]** money for this company, then nothing

**[03:32]** money for this company, then nothing else matters. Doesn't matter if my

**[03:33]** else matters. Doesn't matter if my

**[03:33]** else matters. Doesn't matter if my office is clean or not. So, I think that

**[03:35]** office is clean or not. So, I think that

**[03:35]** office is clean or not. So, I think that trying to get people focused on the

**[03:36]** trying to get people focused on the

**[03:36]** trying to get people focused on the right hard problems and running at them

**[03:38]** right hard problems and running at them

**[03:38]** right hard problems and running at them is is really critical.

**[03:45]** Early years of Facebook, it was sort of

**[03:45]** Early years of Facebook, it was sort of just pants on fire all the time. Wasn't

**[03:47]** just pants on fire all the time. Wasn't

**[03:47]** just pants on fire all the time. Wasn't totally solved, but it wasn't so much

**[03:49]** totally solved, but it wasn't so much

**[03:49]** totally solved, but it wasn't so much consuming all of our energy that we had

**[03:50]** consuming all of our energy that we had

**[03:50]** consuming all of our energy that we had a little bit of energy to look forward.

**[03:53]** a little bit of energy to look forward.

**[03:53]** a little bit of energy to look forward. 2013, Facebook started the AI research.

**[03:56]** 2013, Facebook started the AI research.

**[03:56]** 2013, Facebook started the AI research. One of the questions was, you know,

**[03:57]** One of the questions was, you know,

**[03:57]** One of the questions was, you know, should you establish a more

**[03:59]** should you establish a more

**[03:59]** should you establish a more broad-reaching research lab? There were


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** broad-reaching research lab? There were

**[04:01]** broad-reaching research lab? There were things like Microsoft research or IBM

**[04:03]** things like Microsoft research or IBM

**[04:04]** things like Microsoft research or IBM research or others who were kind of like

**[04:05]** research or others who were kind of like

**[04:05]** research or others who were kind of like could do software theory, could do lots

**[04:07]** could do software theory, could do lots

**[04:07]** could do software theory, could do lots of different areas of technology. The

**[04:09]** of different areas of technology. The

**[04:09]** of different areas of technology. The most preient part of all of this was to

**[04:11]** most preient part of all of this was to

**[04:11]** most preient part of all of this was to say AI is such a big thing and so

**[04:13]** say AI is such a big thing and so

**[04:14]** say AI is such a big thing and so impactful that you wouldn't want to

**[04:16]** impactful that you wouldn't want to

**[04:16]** impactful that you wouldn't want to spend time on these other things. You'd

**[04:17]** spend time on these other things. You'd

**[04:17]** spend time on these other things. You'd want to take all the energy you had and

**[04:19]** want to take all the energy you had and

**[04:19]** want to take all the energy you had and focus it on AI. This is a debate Mark

**[04:21]** focus it on AI. This is a debate Mark

**[04:21]** focus it on AI. This is a debate Mark and I had and I you know I think he was

**[04:23]** and I had and I you know I think he was

**[04:23]** and I had and I you know I think he was the one actually who kind of pushed to

**[04:24]** the one actually who kind of pushed to

**[04:24]** the one actually who kind of pushed to say like let's make sure we just do AI.

**[04:26]** say like let's make sure we just do AI.

**[04:26]** say like let's make sure we just do AI. Part of it was having visibility to what

**[04:28]** Part of it was having visibility to what

**[04:28]** Part of it was having visibility to what was going on in the ecosystem. There was

**[04:30]** was going on in the ecosystem. There was

**[04:30]** was going on in the ecosystem. There was you know this the imageet challenge was

**[04:32]** you know this the imageet challenge was

**[04:32]** you know this the imageet challenge was this famous academic challenge of object

**[04:34]** this famous academic challenge of object

**[04:34]** this famous academic challenge of object identification that no one was paying

**[04:36]** identification that no one was paying

**[04:36]** identification that no one was paying that much attention to except when the

**[04:38]** that much attention to except when the

**[04:38]** that much attention to except when the first neural net entered the challenge

**[04:40]** first neural net entered the challenge

**[04:40]** first neural net entered the challenge and sort of was so much better than

**[04:42]** and sort of was so much better than

**[04:42]** and sort of was so much better than everything else. It is one of these rare

**[04:44]** everything else. It is one of these rare

**[04:44]** everything else. It is one of these rare moments, you know, there are these

**[04:46]** moments, you know, there are these

**[04:46]** moments, you know, there are these moments in tech where something shows up

**[04:47]** moments in tech where something shows up

**[04:47]** moments in tech where something shows up and it's like, "Oh my gosh, that thing

**[04:49]** and it's like, "Oh my gosh, that thing

**[04:49]** and it's like, "Oh my gosh, that thing is like 10% better than anything, a very

**[04:52]** is like 10% better than anything, a very

**[04:52]** is like 10% better than anything, a very large amount compared to any other gap,

**[04:54]** large amount compared to any other gap,

**[04:54]** large amount compared to any other gap, and it used neural net's training on

**[04:56]** and it used neural net's training on

**[04:56]** and it used neural net's training on data." So, it's a different approach.

**[04:58]** data." So, it's a different approach.

**[04:58]** data." So, it's a different approach. You then look at that thing and say

**[04:59]** You then look at that thing and say

**[04:59]** You then look at that thing and say like, okay, is that at the end of its


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** like, okay, is that at the end of its

**[05:02]** like, okay, is that at the end of its runway in terms of capability or is it

**[05:04]** runway in terms of capability or is it

**[05:04]** runway in terms of capability or is it at the beginning? And you say, well,

**[05:05]** at the beginning? And you say, well,

**[05:05]** at the beginning? And you say, well, what's powering it? you say what's

**[05:07]** what's powering it? you say what's

**[05:07]** what's powering it? you say what's powering it is like the size of the

**[05:08]** powering it is like the size of the

**[05:08]** powering it is like the size of the neural net, the size of the data set,

**[05:11]** neural net, the size of the data set,

**[05:11]** neural net, the size of the data set, and the amount of computation you can

**[05:12]** and the amount of computation you can

**[05:12]** and the amount of computation you can give it both in training and in

**[05:14]** give it both in training and in

**[05:14]** give it both in training and in inference. And even at the time it was

**[05:16]** inference. And even at the time it was

**[05:16]** inference. And even at the time it was like wow, we we can scale all of those

**[05:18]** like wow, we we can scale all of those

**[05:18]** like wow, we we can scale all of those things by thousands of times easily. And

**[05:21]** things by thousands of times easily. And

**[05:21]** things by thousands of times easily. And so even if we invent nothing new, you

**[05:24]** so even if we invent nothing new, you

**[05:24]** so even if we invent nothing new, you could get a lot more out of this. And so

**[05:26]** could get a lot more out of this. And so

**[05:26]** could get a lot more out of this. And so this is what I'd like to say is like

**[05:27]** this is what I'd like to say is like

**[05:27]** this is what I'd like to say is like it's a technology with a lot of runway.

**[05:29]** it's a technology with a lot of runway.

**[05:29]** it's a technology with a lot of runway. It's not fully optimized. But but the

**[05:31]** It's not fully optimized. But but the

**[05:31]** It's not fully optimized. But but the point being is as a technology, it was

**[05:33]** point being is as a technology, it was

**[05:33]** point being is as a technology, it was at its infancy in terms of its ability

**[05:34]** at its infancy in terms of its ability

**[05:34]** at its infancy in terms of its ability to grow and scale. And those are the

**[05:36]** to grow and scale. And those are the

**[05:36]** to grow and scale. And those are the things that I think are really exciting.

**[05:38]** things that I think are really exciting.

**[05:38]** things that I think are really exciting. And I think when we've, you know, when

**[05:39]** And I think when we've, you know, when

**[05:39]** And I think when we've, you know, when Meta's invested in them and when I've

**[05:40]** Meta's invested in them and when I've

**[05:40]** Meta's invested in them and when I've invested in them, that's where you have

**[05:48]** there's just not a lot of room for for improvement.

**[05:50]** improvement.

**[05:50]** improvement. Everything always feels obvious and

**[05:53]** Everything always feels obvious and

**[05:53]** Everything always feels obvious and afterthought. And I had definitely seen

**[05:55]** afterthought. And I had definitely seen

**[05:55]** afterthought. And I had definitely seen people who at the time something was

**[05:57]** people who at the time something was

**[05:57]** people who at the time something was coming out questioned and doubted it.

**[05:59]** coming out questioned and doubted it.

**[05:59]** coming out questioned and doubted it. And then 3 years later, it was obvious,


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** And then 3 years later, it was obvious,

**[06:01]** And then 3 years later, it was obvious, oh, I knew all along this was going to

**[06:02]** oh, I knew all along this was going to

**[06:02]** oh, I knew all along this was going to be great. And I was like, no, no, you

**[06:04]** be great. And I was like, no, no, you

**[06:04]** be great. And I was like, no, no, you didn't. Um, and and I think it's fine.

**[06:06]** didn't. Um, and and I think it's fine.

**[06:06]** didn't. Um, and and I think it's fine. It's like human nature to doubt

**[06:07]** It's like human nature to doubt

**[06:07]** It's like human nature to doubt something until you can touch and feel

**[06:08]** something until you can touch and feel

**[06:08]** something until you can touch and feel it. And you had to take that leap. And

**[06:10]** it. And you had to take that leap. And

**[06:10]** it. And you had to take that leap. And not everyone, you know, beginnings of a

**[06:12]** not everyone, you know, beginnings of a

**[06:12]** not everyone, you know, beginnings of a new technology takes that leap and they

**[06:13]** new technology takes that leap and they

**[06:14]** new technology takes that leap and they say, "Well, I I just don't believe it's

**[06:15]** say, "Well, I I just don't believe it's

**[06:15]** say, "Well, I I just don't believe it's going to scale or work." And sometimes

**[06:16]** going to scale or work." And sometimes

**[06:16]** going to scale or work." And sometimes they're right. Like sometimes things

**[06:18]** they're right. Like sometimes things

**[06:18]** they're right. Like sometimes things don't work and they don't scale, you

**[06:19]** don't work and they don't scale, you

**[06:19]** don't work and they don't scale, you know, and then every time you get

**[06:21]** know, and then every time you get

**[06:21]** know, and then every time you get something to a useful point, there's

**[06:23]** something to a useful point, there's

**[06:23]** something to a useful point, there's always some other useful point it hasn't

**[06:24]** always some other useful point it hasn't

**[06:24]** always some other useful point it hasn't done yet. So we you know the very first

**[06:26]** done yet. So we you know the very first

**[06:26]** done yet. So we you know the very first part of AI that started working

**[06:27]** part of AI that started working

**[06:27]** part of AI that started working commercially really well was this sort

**[06:29]** commercially really well was this sort

**[06:29]** commercially really well was this sort of ability to analyze images and to say

**[06:37]** translation started to work reasonably

**[06:37]** translation started to work reasonably well so you could do text you know from

**[06:58]** cat in this photo? And if you think of

**[06:58]** cat in this photo? And if you think of this from a like what can I do with it


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** this from a like what can I do with it

**[07:00]** this from a like what can I do with it standpoint, it wasn't obvious like this

**[07:03]** standpoint, it wasn't obvious like this

**[07:04]** it wasn't good enough to do anything

**[07:04]** it wasn't good enough to do anything with. And so you'd have to look at that

**[07:06]** with. And so you'd have to look at that

**[07:06]** with. And so you'd have to look at that and say like oh no no that'll get better

**[07:09]** and say like oh no no that'll get better

**[07:09]** and say like oh no no that'll get better which is hard for a lot of people to

**[07:12]** which is hard for a lot of people to

**[07:21]** like oh wait it actually can do some

**[07:21]** like oh wait it actually can do some useful things for me now I believe. You

**[07:23]** useful things for me now I believe. You

**[07:23]** useful things for me now I believe. You know, you have a similar experience with

**[07:25]** know, you have a similar experience with

**[07:25]** know, you have a similar experience with self-driving cars. Most people like

**[07:27]** self-driving cars. Most people like

**[07:27]** self-driving cars. Most people like conceptually get scared of them and

**[07:28]** conceptually get scared of them and

**[07:28]** conceptually get scared of them and like, "Oh, it' make me super nervous."

**[07:30]** like, "Oh, it' make me super nervous."

**[07:30]** like, "Oh, it' make me super nervous." I've taken a lot of people on Whimo

**[07:31]** I've taken a lot of people on Whimo

**[07:31]** I've taken a lot of people on Whimo rides in San Francisco. It's one of my

**[07:33]** rides in San Francisco. It's one of my

**[07:33]** rides in San Francisco. It's one of my favorite things to do. You get in the

**[07:34]** favorite things to do. You get in the

**[07:34]** favorite things to do. You get in the back of the car, like 5 minutes in,

**[07:36]** back of the car, like 5 minutes in,

**[07:36]** back of the car, like 5 minutes in, you're bored. You're like, "Oh, it's

**[07:37]** you're bored. You're like, "Oh, it's

**[07:45]** like, "This is boring." And so this is

**[07:45]** like, "This is boring." And so this is the challenge of new technology is I

**[07:47]** the challenge of new technology is I

**[07:47]** the challenge of new technology is I have yet to encounter a new technology

**[07:49]** have yet to encounter a new technology

**[07:49]** have yet to encounter a new technology that until I could show it to you in a

**[07:51]** that until I could show it to you in a

**[07:51]** that until I could show it to you in a way that was obviously useful that you

**[07:53]** way that was obviously useful that you

**[07:53]** way that was obviously useful that you could personally experience. It is so

**[07:55]** could personally experience. It is so

**[07:55]** could personally experience. It is so easy to doubt it. Once you get to that

**[07:56]** easy to doubt it. Once you get to that

**[07:56]** easy to doubt it. Once you get to that point, you've like captured all the

**[07:58]** point, you've like captured all the

**[07:58]** point, you've like captured all the value. So a lot of the challenge is like


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** value. So a lot of the challenge is like

**[08:00]** value. So a lot of the challenge is like how do you identify technologies that

**[08:01]** how do you identify technologies that

**[08:02]** how do you identify technologies that have an opportunity to get to that point

**[08:04]** have an opportunity to get to that point

**[08:04]** have an opportunity to get to that point but aren't there yet? Um because that's

**[08:06]** but aren't there yet? Um because that's

**[08:06]** but aren't there yet? Um because that's where the sort of place to have impact

**[08:08]** where the sort of place to have impact

**[08:08]** where the sort of place to have impact is. So if I'm looking at a new

**[08:10]** is. So if I'm looking at a new

**[08:10]** is. So if I'm looking at a new technology trying to decide whether this

**[08:11]** technology trying to decide whether this

**[08:11]** technology trying to decide whether this is something that might be a breakout,

**[08:13]** is something that might be a breakout,

**[08:14]** is something that might be a breakout, you know, transformative technology, I

**[08:15]** you know, transformative technology, I

**[08:15]** you know, transformative technology, I think there's three core things I'm

**[08:17]** think there's three core things I'm

**[08:17]** think there's three core things I'm looking for. The first and most

**[08:18]** looking for. The first and most

**[08:18]** looking for. The first and most important question is sort of

**[08:20]** important question is sort of

**[08:20]** important question is sort of understanding the light speed test. As

**[08:22]** understanding the light speed test. As

**[08:22]** understanding the light speed test. As far as we know in experimental physics,

**[08:24]** far as we know in experimental physics,

**[08:24]** far as we know in experimental physics, you can't go faster than the speed of

**[08:25]** you can't go faster than the speed of

**[08:25]** you can't go faster than the speed of light. If I was building spacecraft, you

**[08:27]** light. If I was building spacecraft, you

**[08:27]** light. If I was building spacecraft, you know, and I was at 99.9% the speed of

**[08:30]** know, and I was at 99.9% the speed of

**[08:30]** know, and I was at 99.9% the speed of light, there's not a lot of room for me

**[08:32]** light, there's not a lot of room for me

**[08:32]** light, there's not a lot of room for me to get faster, right? And you say, I'm

**[08:33]** to get faster, right? And you say, I'm

**[08:33]** to get faster, right? And you say, I'm going to make it twice as fast. Like

**[08:34]** going to make it twice as fast. Like

**[08:34]** going to make it twice as fast. Like that's really, really, really, really

**[08:36]** that's really, really, really, really

**[08:36]** that's really, really, really, really hard. You know, if I'm at 0.001 Oh, one

**[08:38]** hard. You know, if I'm at 0.001 Oh, one

**[08:38]** hard. You know, if I'm at 0.001 Oh, one the speed of light. I got a lot of room

**[08:40]** the speed of light. I got a lot of room

**[08:40]** the speed of light. I got a lot of room to go before I've hit any theoretical

**[08:41]** to go before I've hit any theoretical

**[08:41]** to go before I've hit any theoretical limit. And so for most technologies, my

**[08:44]** limit. And so for most technologies, my

**[08:44]** limit. And so for most technologies, my first question is how far away from

**[08:47]** first question is how far away from

**[08:47]** first question is how far away from theoretical maximum is the current

**[08:49]** theoretical maximum is the current

**[08:49]** theoretical maximum is the current version of the thing? Like how much

**[08:50]** version of the thing? Like how much

**[08:50]** version of the thing? Like how much headroom do you have to scale an

**[08:52]** headroom do you have to scale an

**[08:52]** headroom do you have to scale an improvement? Is it thousands of times?

**[08:54]** improvement? Is it thousands of times?

**[08:54]** improvement? Is it thousands of times? Is it 1%. Um that's question number one.

**[08:57]** Is it 1%. Um that's question number one.

**[08:57]** Is it 1%. Um that's question number one. Then question number two is are there


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** Then question number two is are there

**[09:00]** Then question number two is are there tailwinds? Are there things that are

**[09:02]** tailwinds? Are there things that are

**[09:02]** tailwinds? Are there things that are happening that make this technology

**[09:04]** happening that make this technology

**[09:04]** happening that make this technology better that you are not working on? And

**[09:06]** better that you are not working on? And

**[09:06]** better that you are not working on? And usually this means that there's some

**[09:08]** usually this means that there's some

**[09:08]** usually this means that there's some input into the component that improves

**[09:10]** input into the component that improves

**[09:10]** input into the component that improves year-over-year without your work. In the

**[09:12]** year-over-year without your work. In the

**[09:12]** year-over-year without your work. In the AI world, for example, the idea of

**[09:14]** AI world, for example, the idea of

**[09:14]** AI world, for example, the idea of getting more compute power was happening

**[09:16]** getting more compute power was happening

**[09:16]** getting more compute power was happening without our effort because Nvidia, TSMC,

**[09:19]** without our effort because Nvidia, TSMC,

**[09:20]** without our effort because Nvidia, TSMC, ASML, the entire chip ecosystem was

**[09:22]** ASML, the entire chip ecosystem was

**[09:22]** ASML, the entire chip ecosystem was developing faster, more powerful chips

**[09:25]** developing faster, more powerful chips

**[09:25]** developing faster, more powerful chips year-over-year. So for the same dollar I

**[09:27]** year-over-year. So for the same dollar I

**[09:27]** year-over-year. So for the same dollar I could get every 18 months about double

**[09:28]** could get every 18 months about double

**[09:28]** could get every 18 months about double the compute power. So I didn't need to

**[09:30]** the compute power. So I didn't need to

**[09:30]** the compute power. So I didn't need to do any work. I didn't need to go build a

**[09:31]** do any work. I didn't need to go build a

**[09:31]** do any work. I didn't need to go build a chip team and go do design chips. It's

**[09:33]** chip team and go do design chips. It's

**[09:33]** chip team and go do design chips. It's just like every year I got more

**[09:34]** just like every year I got more

**[09:34]** just like every year I got more computation without me doing a single

**[09:36]** computation without me doing a single

**[09:36]** computation without me doing a single amount of work. So that's question

**[09:37]** amount of work. So that's question

**[09:37]** amount of work. So that's question number two is do I have some tailwind

**[09:39]** number two is do I have some tailwind

**[09:39]** number two is do I have some tailwind making my product better even when I'm

**[09:41]** making my product better even when I'm

**[09:41]** making my product better even when I'm asleep. And then number three which is

**[09:43]** asleep. And then number three which is

**[09:43]** asleep. And then number three which is the hardest is what problem are you

**[09:46]** the hardest is what problem are you

**[09:46]** the hardest is what problem are you solving and how important is it to your

**[09:48]** solving and how important is it to your

**[09:48]** solving and how important is it to your customer? Your customer could be a

**[09:49]** customer? Your customer could be a

**[09:49]** customer? Your customer could be a consumer could be a company but there

**[09:51]** consumer could be a company but there

**[09:51]** consumer could be a company but there are plenty of amazing technologies that

**[09:53]** are plenty of amazing technologies that

**[09:53]** are plenty of amazing technologies that have made great advances that don't

**[09:55]** have made great advances that don't

**[09:55]** have made great advances that don't actually solve a problem for people. The

**[09:57]** actually solve a problem for people. The

**[09:57]** actually solve a problem for people. The biggest example of this is 3D TVs. For a

**[09:59]** biggest example of this is 3D TVs. For a

**[09:59]** biggest example of this is 3D TVs. For a long time, everyone's like, "Tre is it's


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:01]** long time, everyone's like, "Tre is it's

**[10:01]** long time, everyone's like, "Tre is it's the next step forward from 2D. It's more

**[10:03]** the next step forward from 2D. It's more

**[10:03]** the next step forward from 2D. It's more immersive." It turns out people don't

**[10:05]** immersive." It turns out people don't

**[10:05]** immersive." It turns out people don't want to put like special glasses on, you

**[10:07]** want to put like special glasses on, you

**[10:07]** want to put like special glasses on, you know, and sit in their couch and do it.

**[10:09]** know, and sit in their couch and do it.

**[10:09]** know, and sit in their couch and do it. So 3D TVs were a technological leap that

**[10:12]** So 3D TVs were a technological leap that

**[10:12]** So 3D TVs were a technological leap that didn't solve a problem for consumers

**[10:14]** didn't solve a problem for consumers

**[10:14]** didn't solve a problem for consumers that they cared about. So it's been

**[10:15]** that they cared about. So it's been

**[10:15]** that they cared about. So it's been mostly a failure. What we do with

**[10:17]** mostly a failure. What we do with

**[10:17]** mostly a failure. What we do with advanced technologies is you try to mock

**[10:19]** advanced technologies is you try to mock

**[10:19]** advanced technologies is you try to mock them up and say like, "Okay, I haven't

**[10:21]** them up and say like, "Okay, I haven't

**[10:21]** them up and say like, "Okay, I haven't built the thing yet. what's the best

**[10:22]** built the thing yet. what's the best

**[10:22]** built the thing yet. what's the best sort of proxy of the thing that I can

**[10:24]** sort of proxy of the thing that I can

**[10:24]** sort of proxy of the thing that I can use to show people to get a sense of if

**[10:27]** use to show people to get a sense of if

**[10:27]** use to show people to get a sense of if I built this thing would you like it

**[10:29]** I built this thing would you like it

**[10:29]** I built this thing would you like it that is that customer exploration is is

**[10:31]** that is that customer exploration is is

**[10:31]** that is that customer exploration is is really important because ultimately

**[10:34]** really important because ultimately

**[10:34]** really important because ultimately someone has to buy that technology some

**[10:37]** someone has to buy that technology some

**[10:37]** someone has to buy that technology some business model have to pay for it

**[10:38]** business model have to pay for it

**[10:38]** business model have to pay for it someone has to buy it to fund all the

**[10:40]** someone has to buy it to fund all the

**[10:40]** someone has to buy it to fund all the R&D and if there isn't some loop of

**[10:42]** R&D and if there isn't some loop of

**[10:42]** R&D and if there isn't some loop of money there somewhere it'll eventually

**[10:55]** To me, the problem was obvious. I mean,

**[10:55]** To me, the problem was obvious. I mean, it's something that I've been passionate

**[10:57]** it's something that I've been passionate

**[10:57]** it's something that I've been passionate about for a long time. I had the very

**[10:59]** about for a long time. I had the very

**[10:59]** about for a long time. I had the very first Nissan Leaf, which is the first


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** first Nissan Leaf, which is the first

**[11:00]** first Nissan Leaf, which is the first electric vehicle I could buy. Early

**[11:02]** electric vehicle I could buy. Early

**[11:02]** electric vehicle I could buy. Early generation products. It was terrible.

**[11:03]** generation products. It was terrible.

**[11:03]** generation products. It was terrible. Had very bad range. Really, the question

**[11:05]** Had very bad range. Really, the question

**[11:05]** Had very bad range. Really, the question was, is there really anything I can do

**[11:07]** was, is there really anything I can do

**[11:07]** was, is there really anything I can do about it? It just it feels like a big

**[11:09]** about it? It just it feels like a big

**[11:09]** about it? It just it feels like a big overwhelming problem. And it takes

**[11:11]** overwhelming problem. And it takes

**[14:18]** I could talk a lot more about those but

**[14:18]** I could talk a lot more about those but let's talk about you know just one other

**[14:20]** let's talk about you know just one other

**[14:20]** let's talk about you know just one other example of something that people

**[14:21]** example of something that people

**[14:21]** example of something that people watching this might experience at home

**[14:24]** watching this might experience at home

**[14:24]** watching this might experience at home which is um you know the idea of

**[14:25]** which is um you know the idea of

**[14:25]** which is um you know the idea of throwing away food in the garbage. When

**[14:27]** throwing away food in the garbage. When

**[14:27]** throwing away food in the garbage. When you throw food in the garbage it goes to

**[14:29]** you throw food in the garbage it goes to

**[14:29]** you throw food in the garbage it goes to a landfill. It rots, releases methane.

**[14:31]** a landfill. It rots, releases methane.

**[14:31]** a landfill. It rots, releases methane. This is a major source of near-term

**[14:33]** This is a major source of near-term

**[14:33]** This is a major source of near-term warming and waste. There's a company

**[14:34]** warming and waste. There's a company

**[14:34]** warming and waste. There's a company called Mill. It's a little trash can. It

**[14:36]** called Mill. It's a little trash can. It

**[14:36]** called Mill. It's a little trash can. It looks like a little pop-up trash can. Um

**[14:38]** looks like a little pop-up trash can. Um

**[14:38]** looks like a little pop-up trash can. Um but it's magic. You throw food into it.

**[14:41]** but it's magic. You throw food into it.

**[14:41]** but it's magic. You throw food into it. It dries it up, grinds it up, turns it

**[14:43]** It dries it up, grinds it up, turns it

**[14:43]** It dries it up, grinds it up, turns it into what looks like little coffee

**[14:44]** into what looks like little coffee

**[14:44]** into what looks like little coffee grounds. You can do this in an average

**[14:46]** grounds. You can do this in an average

**[14:46]** grounds. You can do this in an average family home for probably a month and at

**[14:48]** family home for probably a month and at

**[14:48]** family home for probably a month and at the end of that month you have a shoe

**[14:49]** the end of that month you have a shoe

**[14:49]** the end of that month you have a shoe box size of these grounds. Most

**[14:51]** box size of these grounds. Most

**[14:51]** box size of these grounds. Most importantly, it doesn't smell. You don't

**[14:53]** importantly, it doesn't smell. You don't

**[14:53]** importantly, it doesn't smell. You don't have to empty it for a month. And so the

**[14:54]** have to empty it for a month. And so the

**[14:54]** have to empty it for a month. And so the the pitch to consumers is empty your

**[14:57]** the pitch to consumers is empty your

**[14:57]** the pitch to consumers is empty your trash less and it stinks less, you know,

**[14:59]** trash less and it stinks less, you know,

**[14:59]** trash less and it stinks less, you know, and I kind of laugh. Nobody really


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:01]** and I kind of laugh. Nobody really

**[15:01]** and I kind of laugh. Nobody really enjoys emptying their trash. And so I

**[15:02]** enjoys emptying their trash. And so I

**[15:02]** enjoys emptying their trash. And so I would say you can do it less and it's

**[15:04]** would say you can do it less and it's

**[15:04]** would say you can do it less and it's smaller and it stinks less then

**[15:05]** smaller and it stinks less then

**[15:05]** smaller and it stinks less then everyone's excited. And it turns out

**[15:07]** everyone's excited. And it turns out

**[15:07]** everyone's excited. And it turns out this is a major diverter of food waste

**[15:10]** this is a major diverter of food waste

**[15:10]** this is a major diverter of food waste related emissions. And the thing about

**[15:12]** related emissions. And the thing about
