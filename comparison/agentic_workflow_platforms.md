## Platform Details

### n8n

#### Origin Story

n8n was founded in 2019 by **Jan Oberhauser** in Berlin, Germany. Oberhauser launched the open-source core of the n8n platform in September 2019 after realizing the limitations of existing workflow automation tools. The name "n8n" comes from "nodemation" - 'node-' representing Node.js and the node-based visual interface, and '-mation' for automation.

While searching for a domain name, Oberhauser discovered all intuitive names were taken, leading him to choose "nodemation," which eventually became n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n"). He founded n8n to build "the last automation tool technical teams would ever need — one that removed the limitations of traditional workflow automation."

### Glean

#### Origin Story

Glean was founded in 2019 in Palo Alto, California by four former Google engineers: **Arvind Jain** (CEO), **T.R. Vishwanath** (CTO), **Tony Gentilcore**, and **Piyush Prahladka**.

The idea originated from Arvind Jain's experience at Rubrik, a company he co-founded. As Rubrik grew, Jain noticed productivity declining due to knowledge being scattered across numerous applications. During a company survey, he observed that finding information was the "single biggest employee environment issue."

Despite initial skepticism from investors who viewed enterprise search as "a graveyard where no company had ever succeeded," Jain and his co-founders persisted. In September 2021, Glean introduced its assistive search tool, designed to unify information from dozens of disparate applications.

The platform was built on a new technology called SPICE (Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine) to perform advanced calculations and render visualizations rapidly. Initial pricing started at $9 per user per month.

At **re:Invent 2024**, Amazon rebranded QuickSight to **Amazon Quick Suite**, transforming it from a standalone BI service to a comprehensive analytics and AI platform.

She and Waseem, a tech executive from Dubai, pivoted from Qordoba's translation focus to Writer's enterprise generative AI mission.
