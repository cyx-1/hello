## Summary

Akamai Technologies has successfully transformed from its origins as a CDN pioneer into a comprehensive cloud security and computing company. While the legacy Delivery business faces structural decline, the company's Security and Compute segments now represent two-thirds of revenue and continue to grow at strong double-digit rates. The strategic acquisitions of Linode (cloud computing), Guardicore (micro-segmentation), and Noname (API security) position Akamai to compete effectively in the cloud security landscape. With the world's most distributed edge network and deep enterprise relationships, Akamai maintains significant competitive advantages despite intensifying competition from cloud hyperscalers and pure-play security vendors.
