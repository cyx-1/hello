## Main Competitors and Differentiation

### Market Overview

The EDA market is dominated by three major players who together control 85%+ of the market:
- **Cadence Design Systems:** ~30% market share
- **Synopsys:** ~30% market share
- **Siemens EDA (Mentor Graphics):** ~13% market share

### Competitive Comparison

| Company | Revenue (FY2024) | Key Strengths | Primary Focus |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Cadence** | $4.6B | Custom/analog design, verification hardware, system analysis | Full EDA flow, ~90% EDA + 10% IP |
| **Synopsys** | $6.2B | Logic synthesis, verification, design IP | ~70% EDA + 30% IP |
| **Siemens EDA** | ~$1.5B | Cost-effective tools, PCB design, PLM integration | Integrated systems approach |

### Cadence Differentiation

**Technical Strengths:**
- **Custom/Analog Design:** Virtuoso suite is the industry standard for analog/mixed-signal design
