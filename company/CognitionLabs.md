## Main Product: Devin AI

### Product Description

Devin is a collaborative AI teammate that functions as the first fully autonomous AI software engineer. Unlike traditional coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) that provide code suggestions, Devin handles complete engineering workflows from concept to deployment.

### Key Capabilities

- Set up development environments autonomously
- Write, test, and debug code
- Deploy applications
- Open pull requests
- Report progress in real-time
- Long-term reasoning and planning for complex engineering tasks requiring thousands of decisions

### Performance Benchmark

When evaluated on the SWE-Bench benchmark (which asks AI to resolve GitHub issues from real-world open-source projects):
- **Devin:** 13.86% of issues resolved unassisted
- **Previous SOTA:** 1.96% unassisted, 4.80% assisted

### Pricing Evolution

| Version | Date | Pricing Model |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Devin 1.0 | March 2024 | $500/user/month (flat rate) |
| Devin 2.0 | April 2025 | Starting at $20/month for 9 ACUs (Agent Compute Units) |

**Current Pricing Structure (2025):**
- Entry price: $20 for 9 ACUs
- Pay-as-you-go: $2.25 per ACU
- 1 ACU = 15 minutes of active work
- $20 investment ≈ 2.25 hours of active coding assistance
- Price reduction: 96% decrease from original pricing

### Customer Base

3. **Long-term Reasoning:** Advanced planning capabilities for complex tasks requiring thousands of decisions

4. **Agent-Native Platform:** Devin 2.0 features an integrated development environment specifically designed for AI agent collaboration

### Competitor Strategies

- **GitHub Copilot:** Focuses on cost-effectiveness ($10/month unlimited), IDE integration, and real-time assistance
- **Cursor:** Emphasizes context retention within code editor, granular developer control, and managed code changes
- **Replit AI:** Targets rapid prototyping with cloud-based development, no setup required

## Key Annual Events

- **Product Launch Events:** Major version releases (Devin 1.0 in March 2024, Devin 2.0 in April 2025)
- **Funding Announcements:** Multiple high-profile funding rounds demonstrating rapid valuation growth
