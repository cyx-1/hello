## Company Overview and History

### Founders

Databricks was founded in 2013 by seven computer scientists from UC Berkeley:
- **Ali Ghodsi** (CEO since 2016)
- **Ion Stoica**
- **Matei Zaharia** (CTO, creator of Apache Spark)
- **Patrick Wendell**
- **Reynold Xin**
- **Andy Konwinski**
- **Arsalan Tavakoli-Shiraji**

### Origin Story

Databricks grew out of the AMPLab project at University of California, Berkeley. The groundwork began in 2009 when Matei Zaharia created Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing framework built atop Scala, as a researcher at Berkeley's data research center.

The journey started in 2008 at UC Berkeley, where Ali Ghodsi and his team collaborated with Silicon Valley tech companies, witnessing the groundbreaking potential of machine learning. After coming together, they realized the impending need for businesses to process large datasets—a demand that snowballed into the company's founding in 2013.

**Early Funding:** Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz (Andreessen Horowitz) valued the company at $50 million and invested $14 million in their bank account.

### CEO Background

Ali Ghodsi (born 1978) is a Swedish-American computer scientist and entrepreneur of Persian origin, specializing in distributed systems and big data. Born during the Iranian revolution, his family fled to Sweden when he was five years old. He co-founded Databricks in 2013 and became chief executive in 2016.
