# Anysphere (Cursor)

## Company Overview

**Type:** Private Company
**Founded:** 2022
**Headquarters:** San Francisco, California
**Product:** Cursor - AI-powered code editor
**Industry:** Developer Tools, AI Software

## Founders

Anysphere was incorporated in 2022 by four MIT students:
- **Michael Truell** - CEO
- **Sualeh Asif** - Chief Product Officer
- **Arvid Lunnemark** - Former Chief Technology Officer
- **Aman Sanger** - Chief Operating Officer

## Origin Story

The founding story began at MIT in 2022, where the four co-founders identified an opportunity to revolutionize software development through AI integration. While GitHub Copilot (launched in 2021) demonstrated the potential of AI-assisted coding, the founders saw its limitations as a plugin-based solution. They envisioned something more ambitious: an IDE built from the ground up with AI at its core, integrated throughout the entire coding workflow rather than as an add-on feature.

Rather than building a new IDE from scratch, the team made the strategic decision to fork Visual Studio Code, leveraging its established ecosystem and developer familiarity while enabling deep AI integration. This approach allowed them to focus on AI capabilities while providing developers with a familiar interface and compatibility with existing VS Code extensions.
