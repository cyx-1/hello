## Company Mission and Focus Areas

### Core Mission
"Empower humanity through advancing collaborative general intelligence" - building multimodal AI that works WITH people as creative partners and powerful tools rather than replacing them.

### Three Strategic Pillars:
1. **Helping people adapt AI systems to work for their specific needs**
2. **Developing strong foundations to build more capable AI systems**
3. **Fostering a culture of open science** to help the field understand and improve AI systems

### Research Focus Areas:

1. **Infrastructure Quality** - Building reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use infrastructure for research productivity

2. **Advanced Multimodal Capabilities** - Enabling more natural communication through vision, speech, and text

3. **Research and Product Co-design** - Using product deployment for iterative learning and real-world grounding

4. **Open Science** - Frequent publication of research notes, papers, and code to collaborate with global AI community

5. **Continuous Learning Systems** - Building AI that learns and improves through environmental interaction (vs. pure scaling)

## Leadership Team

| Name | Role | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| Mira Murati | Founder & CEO | Former CTO of OpenAI; led development of ChatGPT, DALL-E, GPT-4 |
| Barret Zoph | Co-founder | Former VP of Research (Post-Training) at OpenAI |
| Lilian Weng | Co-founder | Former VP at OpenAI |
| John Schulman | Team Member | OpenAI co-founder (joined after brief stint at Anthropic) |

**Team Composition:**
- ~30 founding researchers and engineers recruited from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, and Mistral AI
- Grown to ~60 employees by late 2025
- Team described as "quality likely to exceed that of Google DeepMind or OpenAI, only approached by Anthropic"

## Origin Story

### Background
Mira Murati served as Chief Technology Officer at OpenAI, where she oversaw the development of groundbreaking products including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GPT-4. She became a prominent face of OpenAI's research efforts.

### The Decision to Leave
In September 2024, Murati announced her departure from OpenAI to pursue "my own exploration." This came during a wider executive exodus that included:
- Bob McGrew (Chief Research Officer)
- Barret Zoph (VP of Research)

### Founding Vision
Murati founded Thinking Machines Lab with a vision distinct from her former employer:
- **Focus on collaboration over replacement** - AI systems that augment human capabilities
- **Continuous learning** - Systems that improve through interaction with environment
- **Multimodal integration** - Natural interfaces combining conversation, vision, and collaboration
- **Open science** - Transparent sharing of research to advance the field

### Key Investors & Backers

**Lead Investor:** Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)
- One of Silicon Valley's most prestigious venture capital firms
- Known for early investments in Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, and other tech giants
