## Summary

Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) is a dominant force in the credit scoring and decision management software industry. With its FICO Score used in 90% of U.S. lending decisions and over 100 billion scores sold, the company has built an exceptionally strong market position protected by regulatory requirements, brand recognition, and network effects.

The company has demonstrated consistent financial performance with double-digit revenue growth and expanding margins, driven by both the Scores segment (through volume growth and pricing power) and the Software segment (through platform SaaS transition). FICO's diversified product portfolio spanning scoring, fraud detection, decision management, and optimization positions it well for continued growth in the data-driven financial services landscape.

Key risks include potential regulatory changes to mortgage scoring requirements, competition from VantageScore and alternative credit data providers, and concentration risk with the three major credit bureaus representing 45% of revenue.
