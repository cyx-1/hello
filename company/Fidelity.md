# Fidelity Investments

## Company Type: Private Company

Fidelity Investments is a privately-held company, meaning it is not publicly traded on any stock exchange. This is notable in an industry dominated by publicly traded companies.

### Ownership Structure

- **Johnson Family**: 49% ownership
- **Employees**: 51% ownership distributed among executives and employees
- **Leadership**: Abigail P. "Abby" Johnson serves as Chairman and CEO (since 2014), representing the third generation of Johnson family leadership
- **Corporate Entity**: FMR LLC (formerly Fidelity Management & Research)

Being privately held allows Fidelity more control over its long-term strategy and shields it from the pressure of quarterly earnings reports.
