### TransDigm's Competitive Advantages

1. **Sole-Source Dominance (75% of Products):**
   - **Proprietary designs:** Patents, trade secrets (Champion spark plug ceramics formula)
   - **Certification lock-in:** FAA PMA approval takes 3-5 years, costs $5M+ → barriers to entry
   - **Example:** Hartwell latches on Boeing 737 doors—no FAA-approved alternative exists
   - **Pricing power:** Sole-source allows value-based pricing (not cost-plus)

2. **Value-Based Pricing Model:**
   - **Price on customer value, not cost:** If a $10,000 pump prevents $5M aircraft grounding, TransDigm charges $8,000 (not $2,000 cost + 20% margin)
   - **DoD controversy:** 2019 House Oversight Committee found 4,451% markup on one part (TransDigm refunded $16.1M but defended model)
   - **Margin result:** 52.6% EBITDA margin vs. industry average 20-25%

3. **Aftermarket Moat (32% of Revenue):**
   - **Consumables:** Spark plugs, seals, filters replaced every 1,000-3,000 flight hours
   - **Regulatory replacement:** Seatbelts (FAA-mandated 12-year replacement)
   - **Installed base:** 30,000+ commercial aircraft with TransDigm parts → captive recurring revenue
   - **Margins:** Aftermarket EBITDA 60-70% vs. OEM 40-45%

4. **Acquisition Playbook (90+ Acquisitions Since 1993):**
   - **Target profile:**
     - Sole-source or limited competition
     - Aftermarket revenue >20%
     - Niche markets ($50M-$500M revenue)
   - **Post-acquisition optimization:**
     - **Price increase:** 3-5% annually on sole-source parts
     - **Margin expansion:** Targets go from 25-30% EBITDA to 45-50% in 3-5 years
     - **Example:** Esterline (2018 acquisition) EBITDA margin: 22% (pre-deal) → 35% (2024)

5. **Decentralized Operating Model:**
   - **60 autonomous subsidiaries:** Each operates as standalone business (P&L responsibility)
   - **No centralized R&D:** Subsidiaries self-fund product development (avoid corporate bloat)
   - **Retention:** Acquired company management typically stays 5-10 years (earn-outs tied to EBITDA growth)

6. **Capital Allocation Discipline:**
   - **No regular dividend:** TransDigm issues special dividends ($30/share in 2017, $35/share in 2023) funded by debt
   - **Leverage tolerance:** 4.5x Net Debt/EBITDA (vs. peers 1-2x)
   - **M&A priority:** $655M Raptor Scientific acquisition (2024) funded with incremental debt
   - **Share buybacks:** Minimal (prefers M&A and special dividends)

7. **Defense Market Positioning:**
   - **40% revenue from defense (FY 2024):** Highest among diversified aerospace suppliers
   - **100+ defense programs:** F-35, CH-47, UH-60, C-130, F/A-18, Apache
   - **Sole-source on critical systems:** Data bus on F-35 (DDC), ignition on CH-47 (Champion)
   - **Long contract duration:** 15-20 year sole-source agreements (F-35 program runs to 2070)

### Market Position

- **Cockpit Door Latches:** #1 with 90% of commercial aircraft doors (Hartwell)
- **Aircraft Spark Ignition Systems:** #1 globally with ~70% market share (Champion Aerospace)
- **Cockpit Security Systems:** #1 with 100% of U.S. commercial aircraft (SCHROTH)
- **Aircraft Seatbelts/Airbags:** #1 with 90% of U.S. commercial aircraft (AmSafe)
